            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, <a href="https://www.hcltech.com/blogs/artificial-intelligence-defined-simple-terms#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20is%20the%20science,decisions%2C%20and%20judge%20like%20humans">is the act of programming technology to act like a human,</a> from simple automation to social intelligence. This includes being able to learn such as acquiring knowledge and then being able to implement it, the ability to reason and draw conclusions and the ability of self-correction. Throughout the years, as technology has rapidly improved, AI has become an integral part in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance-artificial-intelligence-everyday-life-infosense-ai#:~:text=Navigation%20and%20Traffic%3A%20AI%20is,replies%20in%20some%20email%20platforms.">our society’s everyday lives.</a> From entertainment, healthcare, transportation and in education. The education landscape has been transformed through the slow integration of AI, expanding through generative AI tools, capable of crafting entire essays and multimodal content from simple text prompts, plagiarism detection for educational integrity and enhancing administrative processes. AI is constantly evolving, it’s aim to be able to solve complex problems and adapt to new situations, matching if not surpassing human cognitive abilities. AI’s integration into society not only signifies technological advancement but it will require a fundamental shift in the methods to run our society.

                <figcaption>
                    More than half of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/it-and-tech/artificial-intelligence-in-school/#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20can%20offer%20personally,disabilities%20and%20English%20language%20learners."> teachers who responded to Forbes Advisor’s survey</a>  said they believe AI has had a positive effect on the teaching and learning process. Less than 1 in 5 cited a negative effect.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Education has undergone significant transformation in recent years, due to the advancement in technology and of Artificial Intelligence, revolutionising it many ways. <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/sponsored/2023/9/generative-ai-in-education-past-present-and-future">Education before AI</a> predominantly relied on traditional teaching methods and manual administrative labours.
            </p>
            <blockquote class='right'>
                Rose Luckin, a professor of learning-centered design at University College London, is quoted as saying that, “The real power of artificial intelligence for education is in the way that we can use it to process vast amounts of data about learners, about teachers, about teaching and learning interactions.” Ultimately, AI can “help teachers understand their students more accurately, more effectively.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                It often standardised learning without the having the ability to cater to individual student’s needs. This was also very labour intensive on educators, the grading of assessments being a time-consuming task, taking up time that could be otherwise spent on other tasks to deepen the learning of students or even to give more free time to educators to spend on themselves or family. Administrative tasks, such as scheduling courses and managing facilities are labour-intensive tasks which must be done with particular care lest the student suffer as a result. However, with the integration of AI, education has undergone a profound transformation, many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilsahota/2023/12/15/precision-education-how-k-12-schools-are-embracing-ai/?sh=541d33242a9d">schools having integrated </a> AI tools to provide personalised learning to fit individual children’s needs and enhancing their learning by analysing learning patterns in order to deliver customised resources and learning. An example would be <a href="https://www.carnegielearning.com/solutions/math/mathia/"> Carnegie Learning's MATHia</a> software which is an AI math software that’s designed to provide individual student support and insightful data. As well as catering to student’s individual learning abilities, AI also has the ability to streamline administrative tasks, therefore saving educators time on class preparation and assessment grading, reduce teachers' preparation time, improving teaching quality and student-teacher interactions. AI in education optimisies efficiency, enhances student learning and prepares students for future success in our rapidly technology and AI-driven society.

            <h2>How is Artificial Intelligence Already Being Used in Education?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adaptive Learning</strong></li>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.montclair.edu/itds/digital-pedagogy/pedagogical-strategies-and-practices/adaptive-learning/#:~:text=Adaptive%20learning%20is%20a%20technique,to%20provide%20personalized%20learning%20experiences." > Adaptive Learning is </a> a technique which utilises algorithms in order to track and collect data on students' learning patterns, providing valuable insights to educators and allowing teachers to customise educational content and improve the learning of their students. This continuous assessment of students' performances, progress and engagement allows for strategies to be adapted, promoting greater engagement, improving student mastery of concepts and overall helping students reach greater academic success.
                </p>

                <li><strong>Assistive Technology</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Assistive technology <a href="https://education.nsw.gov.au/schooling/parents-and-carers/inclusive-learning-support/high-school/how-your-child-can-be-supported-in-high-school/assistive-technology#:~:text=Some%20examples%20that%20might%20be,for%20magnifying%20text%20or%20images" > refers to </a>a device, tool, system or AI that assists in the performance of a task they may not be able to complete otherwise. This AI can help special needs students access a more equitable education, <a href="https://at4kids.com/blog/mqc4chyo1xhtim2ffsvl83ujaycaw4#:~:text=Learning%20Support%3A%20Learning%20can%20be,ask%20some%20basic%20comprehension%20questions!" > for example </a>AI-powered speech recognition which can speak and interpret speech for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, allowing them to better understand others and therefore, improve their learning ability. AI has also rapidly improved for those with visual impairment issues, AI that can recognise and describe objects, identify people and read text aloud. Even Smart Assistant Devices such as Siri and Alexa are virtual AI assistants which can respond to spoken questions and have ability to perform tasks at request, allowing students with disabilities to control their environments.
                </p>

                <li><strong>Interactive Learning</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Interactive learning AI <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2023.1141649/full" > in education is the </a>development and then subsequent application of creating physical learning environments, which are capable of adapting to personalise for each student’s experience. This is for the purpose of engaging students in immersive learning experiences to foster deeper understandings and to improve retention of content. AI technology is currently being used to improve the connectivity between students and then consequently their interactions, and the personalisation of learning activities to improve student’s learning, for example interactive games that teach children basic academic skills, interactive simulations. Chatbots can serve as virtual tutors, being able to offer feedback quicker than a teacher. By promoting engagement, collaboration, and critical thinking skills, interactive learning AI enhances learning outcomes and prepares students for success in an increasingly digital and interactive world.
                </p>

                <li><strong>Data and Learning Analytics</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Another useful tool that AI can provide to teachers and education administrators to analyse and interpret data, enabling them to make better-informed decisions for the welfare of a student’s learning. <a href="https://www.digitallearninginstitute.com/blog/ai-driven-evolution-in-learning-analytics-for-digital-education" > AI is able to </a>process and store vast amounts of data, much more efficiently and effectively than humans or even most learning management systems like <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas" > Canvas </a>as it can analyse data and identify complex patterns that educators may miss or overlook. AI predictive analytics is when AI makes an assumption on future trends of learning, based on data from previous learning behaviours and performance. This allows educators to prepare for forecasted students at risk of falling behind. AI’s ability to automate reporting allows educators to spend less time analysing data from multiple sources and merging them into one source, AI being able to do this much more efficiently than any person would be able to. This integration of AI into education has offered insights into a student’s learning that were previously impossible for educators before.
                </p>

                <li><strong>Scheduling</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Scheduling and timetables are an extremely important factor in the running of schools and in education as a whole, <a href="https://www.cronofy.com/blog/ai-education" > being used to </a>keep students and teachers informed of where they much be, which times etc. Traditional scheduling before the integration of AI, predominantly did not account current schedules and was prone to result in double-bookings. The addition of AI into education has assisted in helping administrators to schedule courses and timetables as well has aiding individuals to manage their daily, weekly, monthly or yearly schedules and it can do this all within seconds. AI technology is able to access multiple data sets at once and therefore there’s no risk of scheduling conflicts to arise and it can also help prevent miscommunications and offer poor scheduling solutions. AI such as a calendar sync can also be used to make it easier for teachers to book out resources such as classrooms or iPads, assisting them in planning their lessons around the availabilities and substituting teachers can be efficiently and effectively organised.
                </p>

                <li><strong>Overall School and Facility Management</strong></li>
                <p>
                    AI is currently being used to manage entire schools, powering student records systems, transportation, IT, maintenance, scheduling, budgeting, etc. AI is effective at monitoring the status of power, Wi-Fi and water services; alerting the facilities management workers when problems arise. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/colleges-that-received-the-most-applications" >Studies show </a>the average US collage receives up to 17,870 applications each year, AI is able to filter through those admission essays to examine if students have used particular phrases or key terms. <a href="https://www.cronofy.com/blog/ai-education" >AI is able to </a>filter through those admission essays to examine if students have used particular phrases or key terms. <a href="https://www.cronofy.com/blog/calendar-sync-chatbots" >AI chatbots can be used </a>to answer common questions students have, saving staff from spending hours answering students’ questions by email. AI is used in scheduling, making it easier and simpler to use and thereby improving student’s learning and leaving them with a more positive perspective about the educational institution as a whole.

            <h2>Legal, Social and Ethical Issues of Artificial Intelligence in Education</h2>
            <p>
                Although the integration of AI in education has a lot of benefits, to the student’s learning, to assisting the teacher’s ability to help students and even how educational facilities are run, AI has a myriad of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455229/" > legal, ethical and social issues</a>that must be considered.
            </p>
            <h3>Legal</h3>
            <p>
                As AI is increasingly used in education, legal issues such as data privacy and intellectual property rights arise. Privacy violations mainly occur as people expose personal information in online platforms at an excessive amount and although there are already existing standards and legislations to protect user’s personal data, many students and teachers are majorly concerned about their data privacy with the influx of AI. Many AI systems ask for users consent to access their personal data in order to address concerns from the public on these issues, however many users do not comprehend the extent of information that they are sharing with AI, such as their location, language, racial identity etc. Laws such as the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/data-protection/data-protection-regulation/#:~:text=data%20protection%20rules-,What%20is%20the%20GDPR%3F,application%20on%2025%20May%202018." >General Data Protection Regulation</a>in the European Union and the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" > California Consumer Privacy Act </a> in the United States mandate strict requirements for the collection, use, and sharing of personal data, including provisions for consent, data minimization, and data subject rights. Failure to adhere to these regulations can result in severe legal consequences, including fines, penalties, and reputational damage for educational institutions and AI technology providers. The issues with AI vs Intellectual property has been <a href="https://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/artificial_intelligence/policy.html" > a longstanding debate.</a> Does AI innovation and creation need Intellectual Property incentives? How should the value of human invention and creation be balanced against AI innovation and creation? Does the advent of AI require any changes to the existing Intellectual Property frameworks such as copyright licenses? Educational materials, student records, and proprietary algorithms used in AI systems may be subject to copyright, trademark, or trade secret protections, necessitating careful management and safeguarding of intellectual property assets. The unauthorised access or the misuse of any of this confidential information by AI systems may result in legal disputes, litigation, and liability for data breaches or intellectual property infringement. 
            </p>
            <h3>Social</h3>
            <p>
                The integration of AI in education raises many ethical dilemmas as well as legal dilemmas. These ethical concerns including systemic bias and discrimination in AI algorithms. As AI can only learn from its sources, it can often take on the biases, misinformation, and problematic content of the original material. It's almost guaranteed that implicit bias will be woven into the framework of the tool, <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/news/2022/06/03/four-issues-that-hound-facial-recognition-technology/" >as facial and vocal recognition in AI has illustrated </a> as it has recently been fraught with controversy due to racial and gender bias. These algorithms are shaped by cultural, social, and institutional forces and they risk amplifying existing injustices and inequities, especially for disadvantaged and marginalised groups. Furthermore, AI-driven surveillance and tracking systems infringe upon students' and teachers' privacy rights, as they gather detailed information about their actions and preferences. The use of predictive algorithms in monitoring student behaviour not only compromises autonomy but also perpetuates biases and prejudices, leading to unfair outcomes and reinforcing social stratification.
            </p>
            <h3>Ethical:</h3>
            <p>
                At a societal level, AI’s impact on education extends beyond the classroom and shapes broader social attitudes and norms. The use of biased decision-making algorithms in automated assessment systems, as demonstrated by the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/research/grade/#:~:text=There%20was%20immediate%20public%20outcry,especially%20low%20in%20smaller%20centres." > 2020 controversy surrounding A-level and GCSE exams in England,</a> where the AI Ofqual was tasked with preventing grade inflation and ensuring grading consistency but instead viewed students’ CAGs as overly optimistic and so replaced them with calculated grades predicted via their Direct Centre-level Performance. This resulting in 40% of CAGs being downgraded by one or more grades. This highlights the potential of AI to exacerbate inequality and undermine trust in educational institutions. Additionally, the proliferation of AI-generated content and virtual assistants in education requires critical discussion and awareness of the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making and its impact on human agency and autonomy.

            <h2>Is Artificial Intelligence in Education Good or Bad?</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence in Education has had many affects, both good and bad. AI technology has revolutionised the educational landscape, offering personalized learning experiences, streamlining administrative tasks, and enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness in teaching and learning. 
            </p>

            <blockquote class='left'>
                “Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.” — Stephen Hawking
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                However, the widespread adoption of AI in education also raises complex legal, ethical, and social issues that must be carefully addressed. It is not possible to say if AI in education is overall a good or bad thing, AI is the future of our society and therefore, students must learn to use it in our everyday aspects of life including education and they must be taught how to use it correctly. By fostering critical dialogue, promoting transparency and accountability, and prioritizing the protection of individuals' rights and privacy, the transformative potential of AI to create a more equitable, inclusive, and effective educational system and future for all is possible.
