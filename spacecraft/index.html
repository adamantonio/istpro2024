            <h2>Rundown on Spacecraft</h2>
            <p>
                Spacecraft allows humans to be able to reach distant places far beyond our imaginations and beyond the reaches of our known world, to a far bigger space beyond. This space is known as the universe. The universe is wondrous and dangerous at the same time. It is infinite and constantly expanding and evolving, the universe includes many things that are made up of vast amounts of energy that took millions or billions or years to accumulate and become what it is today. It is terrifying to think that most things in space can kill us without any effort at all. We are so fragile compared to these colossal things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spacecraft can include, space shuttles, satellites, space stations and space rovers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/spacecraft">Spacecraft</a> are vehicles designed to operate in a controlled orbit (flight pattern) with or without a crew around the Earth. Such as probes, satellites and space shuttles. Sometimes spacecraft may be sent out to explore the wider universe, such as to Mars, the Sun, Moon or further out beyond the solar system.

            <p>
                Spacecraft need an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/deep-space-probe">onboard source of power</a> to be able to operate all the equipment. If the spacecraft is orbiting around the Earth, then it may use solar panels to get energy from the sun. If the spacecraft is further away from the sun (deep space probes), such as at Jupiter, then it will use small but long-lived radioisotope thermoelectric generators to convert heat radiated from a radioactive element to use as energy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However there are precious few spacecraft that have made it past our solar system into interstellar space. <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/voyager-2/  ">Voyager 1</a> and <a href="https://www.space.com/17688-voyager-1.html  ">Voyager 2</a> are the only space probs to have made it. Our technology has a long way to go still to be able to further explore the galaxy, currently we'll have to make do with seeing things from afar with a powerful telescope (James Webb).

            <h2>Effects of spacecraft</h2>
            <p>
                With spacecraft so many more options are available for us. We can explore the stars in hopes of finding an alien race or even a <a href="https://www.space.com/30172-six-most-earth-like-alien-planets.html">habitable planet</a> for us to occupy. We want to broaden our horizons and expand past Earth.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans are naturally curious, we like to explore and poke our noses where they don’t belong. Won’t it be worth the satisfaction when someday all that work in space exploration pays off and we finally have the answer to centuries long questions? 
            </p>

                There are many reasons for different countries to want to go to space, perhaps they want bragging rights or to be able to advance their technology faster than other countries. In the end the nations could be united if there’s a common goal they’re aiming for.

            <h3>Issues with spacecraft</h3>
            <p>
                Yet despite all that, so much time and effort has been spent on spacecraft and the results have been less than satisfactory. There are also many concerns and uncertainties regarding the future of space. If a suitable planet was found, how would we get there? When spacecraft develops further will we start colonizing other worlds? What would we do if we found an alien race? If we colonized other worlds who would get what land? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although there are already are <a href="https://spacelaws.com/space-law-fundamentals/#:~:text=Article%20I%20of%20the%20Outer,access%20to%20all%20areas%20of">space laws</a> in place, for countries that are exploring space to follow, the laws were all made quite some time ago. It might not be suitable anymore for the current modern era. These laws also have not had much opportunity to be put into practice either, perhaps countries follow it not, but if a country were to break the laws what would the punishment be? If there are no consequences to breaking these rules, then there’s really no point in having the rules in the first place. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There have been many wars in history already, with people fighting for land and resources. Who’s to say that won’t happen again? <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-11/what-would-america-look-like-if-it-lost-world-war-iii>Except this time in space</a>. The effects of that would be devastating, especially since many countries have access to nuclear power and far superior technology from WWII. Although perhaps it would be different, as there might actually be less destruction in space. But do the rules of war on Earth apply to space?
            </p>

            <p>
                Another issue also arises in our <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/astrobioethics/AB72BF5A327A011B9C4EA3E2C2475C87">treatment of the planet</a> and <a href=https://trilateralresearch.com/research-highlights/the-ethics-of-space-exploration>any potential living organisms</a> that may be found during space exploration. Any living organisms found would likely be brought back to study in a lab somewhere. I mean why not? Scientists would love the opportunity to be able to discover a new species or figure out how to survive in space for long periods without a spacesuit or oxygen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be a great leap for humanity if we could figure it out. Right? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Right. This kind of action would be deemed morally unjust and unethical if humans were to be experimented on. So why is it different for another species? Why is it suddenly fine when it’s not humans? Is it because they’re not like us, and different?   
            </p>
            <p>
                Aren’t we all living organisms? What makes us different in that regard? It isn’t fine. 
            </p>

            <h2>Recommendation</h2>
            <p>
                I believe what we should focus on currently is our Earth. We should care for it, and not destroy life on Earth. Preserve life. So <a href="">many species are now going extinct</a> and the Earth itself is on the way to being <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/19/un-weather-agency-issues-red-alert-on-climate-change-after-record-heat">destroyed</a>. Plastic is piling up in the oceans as whole islands of space are taken up and marine life is heavily affected by this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7167/proxima-centauri-b/">nearest habitable planets</a> are way too far away for us with our current technology to get there. It would take too long and if we did find our way there, we don't have a guarantee that it is livable, nor do we have the resources to colonize a planet. All the planets in our solar system are too deadly for us to live on. <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/venus/">Venus</a> is too hot, while <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mars/">Mars</a> is too cold, and the atmosphere is too thin so there is constantly space debris raining down on the planet. Although scientists are trying to find evidence that Mars could have life on it, it would take a long time and, in that time, if we let our planet keep on self-destructing because of human activity we might not live to see that.

                "Glaciers monitored since 1950 lost the most ice on record. Antarctic sea ice retreated to its lowest level ever."
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                It is imperative that we take care of our planet first and foremost before looking to the stars for more solutions. Although I'm not saying that we should stop space exploration, the Earth should simply be the higher priority.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence although space is a goldmine for any potential scientists or astrologers, it could reveal possible mind-blowing revelations of the world or even be our future someday our capabilities are limited. Instead of wasting millions of dollars on a venture that we don’t have the proper technology for, that money can be used to improve life on Earth and make our planet a better place.
