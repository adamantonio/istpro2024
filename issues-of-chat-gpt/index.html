            <h2>About Chat GPT</h2>

            <p>
                Chat GPT is a language model, developed by OpenAI, a company that has designed multiple AI apps, it is programmed to engage users in a human-like style of chatting, also is capable of creating essays, drafting emails, gathering information, which can save users a lot of time. Over time, Chat GPT also evolves, learning using a machine learning algorithm, improving its overall performance. Chat GPT’s main purpose revolves around its ability to generate human-like text that provides information among various topics, making it a helpful tool for anyone. 
            </p>
            <p>Chat GPT is required in Virtual Assistants, where it is used to improve the conversational abilities and more natural interactions. An example is Expedia, a popular travel planning website, who has integrated conversations AI assistance into its services. Customers can now plan their vacations as if they are chatting with a friendly knowledgeable travel agent. Chat GPT can also be utilised for learning purposes. For example, Chat GPT is used in Duolingo, a language education specialist who developed Duolingo Max. Duolingo Max is powered by GPT-4 and enables language students to get in-depth explanations of why their answers to test questions were incorrect, similar to an in real life tutor. </p>            
            <p>Microsoft investment in ChatGPT involved a massive hardware investment in data centres. ChatGPT runs on the Azure hardware in Microsoft data centres. To train a large language models required partitioning workload across thousands of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) in a cluster, and an InfiniBand network pushes the data around at high speed.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Chat GPT</h2>
            <p>
                Chat GPT can be seen in positive light as a virtual life companion, due to its outstanding capabilities of performing human-like discussions, it can converse with the user in a normal conversation, having a favourable impact on those who are merely in search of some form of entertainment or conversation. Although, that’s not what it’s only used for. Many students may seek the help of Chat GPT, not for its companionship or to test out its impressive programming behind the human-like conversations, but rather for the convenience of quick information gathering. Chat GPT comes with many other features besides just basic conversation programming, it can provide students with necessary resources for research without the need for the student to do extensive work. Chat GPT can come up with answers to simple questions as well as draft emails, homework, essays and even assignments, all upon command. This is extremely beneficial and convenient for students who do not wish to waste their time gathering and research for information when they can just get answers the faster way. With this AI model, students have access to a source full of info they can get with a quick question, causing essay writing, research gathering to be a much simpler task than without Chat GPT. The features of Chat GPT also extend to coding, being able to write out a computer code, when given the aim and intentions of the code.

            <h3>Issues with Chat GPT</h3>
            <p>
                Despite all the beneficial features Chat GPT comes with, issues are also associated with such convenience for example having the bright futures of students being ruined due to their dependence on AI. Chat GPT is not perfect. It can provide users with inaccurate information and many students, because of reliance on Chat GPT, can act naively and trust every piece of research given to them by it. This could cause an essay to come out wrong, having fake information used. This proves to be a social issue as AI can be spreading false information among people. This means Chat GPT could be contributing to the spread of misinformation. Another issue that can arise from Chat GPT is students commanding AI to construct an essay for a graded project or assessment. This can be seen as both plagiarism and cheating. This makes Chat GPT contributing to destroying the student’s future and education. Due to the the student relying on Chat GPT to the extent that they also entrust all essays and homework to Chat GPT which could lead to them not improving their own writing skills. Therefore leading to a student’s education being ruined. This could prove to be both an legal and ethical issue. It is a legal issue because it involves using unauthorised work of AI’s, not only is this not the own work of the student’s but it also consists of the student’s false claims of this being their own work without acknowledging AI’s help. Chat GPT, therefore sabotages the a student’s future by giving them this opportunity of stealing work and managing to get passed without having to do writing themselves. This proves to a legal issue as it goes against rules of plagiarism and goes against copyright laws and policies while claiming the essays written by Chat GPT, to be their own work. This issue also proves to be an ethical issue as it is the simple issues of right or wrong and using AI to gather information and research to assist in writing essays or homework isn’t illegal but having Chat GPT completely write the essay is definitely wrong. For example, when writing an essay for an assignment, and sending the details to AI to make gathering research easier isn’t completely wrong if assistance of the AI is acknowledged but when the assistance of AI is not regarded or even worse, having Chat GPT write the whole essay, is when this would be seen as an ethical issue.

            <h2>Strategies to prevent the issues</h2>
            <p>
                Strategies to prevent Chat GPT being used and relied on when writing essays for assessments, include promoting awareness of this issue. Having AI detectors can be seen as a solution but not really a prevention as it doesn’t prevent students from plagiarising AI work in the first place, rather, it only catches students plagiarising, taking Chat GPT’s work without mentioning and referring to it. Promoting awareness can involve making the students go through a course, educating them on the importance of referencing where the information is from to prevent any plagiarism as well as encouraging students to not follow this path. Chat GPT can be relied on for gathering information but when gathering these information, it is better for users to check if they are legit and accurate first as many pieces of information may be inaccurate and not appropriate from Chat GPT and although they have been referenced correctly and have no plagiarism involved, misinformation can still pose as a threat to one’s education and future. Acceptable use of this technology would consist of referencing the assistance of AI, also checking another site for information to check whether the information from AI was false or not.
