            <h2>Intro to Facial Recognition</h2>
            <h3>What is Facial Recognition?</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system">Facial recognition</a> is a <strong>technology</strong>, often powered by <em>artificial intelligence</em> that identifies or verifies a person’s identity <strong>using their face</strong>. It works by <strong>mapping</strong> facial features from a photograph or video, and then comparing this information with a database of known faces to <strong>find a match</strong>.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technology can identify human faces in images or videos, determine if the face in two images belongs to the same person, or search for a specific face among a large collection of images. It’s a type of biometric security, similar to voice recognition, fingerprint recognition, and iris recognition.
                </p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
           
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Image</strong>- An image is taken from either a photograph or a video frame</li>
                <li><strong>Detection</strong>-A face is detected through analysing their facial features </li>
                <li><strong>Extraction</strong>-Features such as the eyes, nose, mouth, etc are extracted</li>
                <li><strong>Faceprint</strong>- A faceprint is created, and is then compared to that of others in a database</li>
                <li><strong>Result</strong>- The result of the comparison is determined.</li>
            </ol>  

            <h3>Existing software</h3>
            <h4>Hardware:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image capturing devices</strong>- Used to capture images such as a camera or phone. </li>
                
            </ul>  
            <h4>Software:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Face detection and analysis</strong>- Locates a face in an image </li>
                <li><strong>Feature extraction</strong>- Details such as the distance between the eyes, depth of the eye sockets, shape of the cheekbones, and contour of the lips, cheeks etc is detected. </li>
                <li><strong>Faceprint creation</strong>- All the information in converted into numbers or points called a faceprint</li>
                <li><strong>Faceprint comparison</strong>- The numbers, (or faceprint) is compared to that of other faces in the database</li>
            </ul>  
            <h4>Database:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collection of Identities</strong>- An existing collection of identities, which can be anything from databases to images from social media.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Issues and Consequences</h2>
            <h3>Bias and Discrimination</h3>
            <p>
                One of the major issues is the presence of algorithmic bias, which often results in racial and gender disparities. These biases can lead to misidentification, particularly in people of colour, and women as uncovered in the film Coded Bias (2020), further extending existing inequalities.
                Studies have shown that facial recognition systems have higher error rates for women and people of colour. For instance, a staggering 35% of facial recognition errors occur when identifying women of colour, compared to a mere 1% error rate for white males. This can lead to false positives, where innocent individuals may face unwarranted suspicion or even arrest because an algorithm mistakenly identifies them as a criminal.
                Law enforcement agencies heavily rely on facial recognition algorithms and mugshot databases to identify individuals. This reliance can form a troubling feedback loop, where biased policing strategies result in disproportionate and unjust arrests.
            </p>
            <p>
                As facial recognition technology is likely to be used in many industries in the future, including public health and law enforcement, it is critical to ensure that discrimination is not embedded in the design of these technologies. This discrimination may lead to unfair treatment, including arrests, service denials, and other forms of discrimination.
                Addressing these biases and ensuring that facial recognition technology is created and applied ethically is essential. This includes the need for transparency, accountability, and ongoing evaluation of these systems to prevent unintended consequences and to protect the rights of all individuals.

            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p> Westfield shopping centres, owned by the Scentre Group, have been using a technology known as “facial detection” in their digital advertising billboards12. These billboards, named SmartScreens, are equipped with cameras that can determine your age, gender, and even mood while you shop -  such as whether you’re very happy, or not, using this information to target consumers’. </p>
            <p>However, there are ethical concerns associated with this technology. One of the main issues is transparency. While Scentre Group emphasizes that all data collected is anonymous and that they are using facial detection, not facial recognition technology1, it raises the question on transparency: do consumers know they’re being filmed? The use of the term “facial detection” can be a misleading term, leading to confusion and misinterpretation among consumers about what data is being collected and how it’s being used. Facial recognition is increasingly

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Algorithmic bias </strong>– Companies should invest in improving the algorithms used in facial recognition to reduce racial and gender bias. This could involve using more diverse sample data and implementing rigorous testing to ensure the system works equally well for all groups of people. The use of de-biasing variational auto-encoders can also be implemented, which are able to automatically discover and mitigate hidden biases among training data.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transparency and consent </strong>– Companies should be transparent about their use of facial recognition technology. This includes informing customers when their biometric data is being collected and how it’s being used. In the case of Westfield, customers should be made aware that they’re being filmed and that their data is being used for targeted advertising. Companies should obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting their biometric data. This could be done through clear signage in areas where facial recognition is in use or through direct communication with customers.

                Facial Recognition technology has a kind of mystery to it – we don’t really know how it operates, but we know people much smarter than us created it. Theres a tendency to place trust in a system we don’t fully understand.” – Clare Garvie

                    <strong>Data protection -</strong>– Companies should implement strong data protection measures to ensure the biometric data they collect is stored securely and used responsibly. This includes anonymizing data where possible and implementing robust cybersecurity measures.
