            <h2>About GPS</h2>
            <p>
                A Global Positioning System (GPS) is used to determine the location of someone or something on earth, using various satellites and receiving devices. Common products that make use of GPS technology include cars, smartphones and watches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main feature of the GPS tracking system is to give real-time location data. 
                Other features include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Location tracking:</b> to provide precise and real time location data</li>
                <li>Speed monitoring: GPS speed monitoring uses satellites to determine three-dimensional speed and uses satellite signals to provide precise readings.</li>
                <li>Maintenance reports: GPS data can be used to create predictive maintenance schedules based on asset, age, condition, usage and location. </li>
                <li>Navigation: getting from one location to another.</li>
                <li>Mapping: Creating maps of the world. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There is a limited amount of hardware and software involved in GPS, the hardware consists of three main parts the antenna which receives the signal from the satellites, a receiver-processor unit which converts the radio signal to a navigational solution and finally a control/display unit which displays the information. The GPS software is used to manage, program and monitor the GPS receivers and devices that provide the position of objects on earth. Examples of these software include ‘clearpathGPS’, ‘GPSwox’ – there are thousands of different software’s to choose from depending on your needs.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of GPS:</h3>
            <p>There are 4 main types of GPS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A-GPS: Assisted GPS allows receivers to get info from local network sources. It is normally used in areas where satellite signals cannot easily reach due to interference such as tall buildings.</li>
                <li>S-GPS: Simultaneous GPS is a modified version of GPS which allows both voice-data and GPS signalling to be transmitted from a phone. Both data types are simultaneously rather than alternating the SPS  signal and the reception for the telephone call and there is better sensitivity. This is particularly useful for emergency services, to locate the source of a call.</li>
                <li>D-GPS: Differential GPS is a correction technique used to increase the accuracy of location data collected from a traditional GPS server. D-GPS is an enhancement to GPS, giving a better sense of the actual location, narrowing the location error limit to (2.5cm). </li>
                <li>Non-Differential GPS: Uses direct satellite signals to deduce positioning, it is less accurate than Differential GPS but has a wider range of use.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Benefits of GPS</h3>
            <p>GPS is a <a href="https://landairsea.com/reasons-why-gps-is-vital-to-our-society/">vital technology</a> as it helps with navigation, tracking, traffic and weather, safety, crime and security and increased productivity. GPS keeps society safe by providing the exact location of someone or something in emergencies by using devices such as a trackers, phones, and cameras. GPS allows us to get to places on time and is vital for navigation assisting to reduce the number of accidents and car injuries on the roads. GPS also assists Police and emergency services to respond quickly as they are able to see the exact location through S-GPS tracking. GPS increases productivity, so that companies and businesses can make better use of their resources and employees, for example optimizing routes using GPS and tracking shipping/orders. </p>

            <h2>'Spoofing'</h2>
            <blockquote class='right'>
                "Russia engaged in nearly 10,000 spoofing cases"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                GPS can enable unauthorised surveillance without the consent of an individual. An example of this is <a href= "https://www.okta.com/au/identity-101/gps-spoofing/">'spoofing'</a> which is when an individual sends false GPS signals to a receiver tricking the receiver into thinking the object they are tracking is in a different location, this can lead to kidnapping and consequences such as misleading aircraft and ships. When spoofing occurs, a radio transmitter sends fake GPS signals to a target receiver, giving the smart phone or receiver a false location. The attacks of spoofing in 2022 rose by 61%, as security measures were relaxed making it easier for hackers to attack businesses and interfere with signals. There are different types of spoofing, such as involvement with expensive equipment and expert operators, for example when Russia engaged in spoofing nearly 10,000 civilian ships to prevent drones from approaching President Putin and to safeguard sensitive sites. Spoofing can also be accomplished with cheap, available equipment, using software-defined radios and running open-source software, to intercept signals. 
            </p>
            <h3>Harms of GPS 'Spoofing'</h3>
            <p>
                Some of the main dangers involved with Spoofing include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interfering with GPS at airports: this can cause a plane to go off course or have to attempt a blind landing, putting all passengers and crew at risk.</li>
                <li>Misdirecting cargo shipments to alternate locations to steal shipments: often ships use GPS enabled locks, that are only unlocked when they reach their destination, however spoofers can unlock these.</li>
                <li>Sending people to the wrong location: GPS spoofing can send the wrong location to an individual through an app, sending them to a dangerous location or into the hands of a kidnapper, an example of this is blind dating apps, GPS spoofing can interfere with the signal and send the receiver an incorrect location. </li>
                <li>Misdirecting cars: Drivers and cars often use GPS to reach an unfamiliar destination, when this information is ‘spoofed’ they can be sent off course, this is specifically dangerous for self-driving cars. </li>
                <li>Disrupting the universal time source: financial companies, power utilities and telecommunication companies all use the <a href="https://www.euspa.europa.eu/european-space/eu-space-programme/what-gnss#:~:text=Global%20Navigation%20Satellite%20System%20(%20GNSS,definition%2C%20GNSS%20provides%20global%20coverage.">GNSS</a> (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) universal time source. If the GNSS is spoofed it could potentially crash the financial markets, cause blackouts and interfere with the communication grids. </li>
                <li>Disrupting services through mobile apps/websites: Location data is used by many apps especially delivery apps, when spoofed an incorrect address or information could be sent.</li>
    
            </ul>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                There are a few ways to prevent spoofing and to protect yourself and/or business from risk. Some of these methods include cryptography, which is where organisations encrypt the satellite codes coming and going, so that only those with access can read the messages. Obscure or hide your real antennas, make sure they are not visible to the public by installing a barrier or putting them in a place where they will not be seen. The location of the antennas in also important, place antennas away from buildings and public locations to reduce the chance of interference with signals. Invest in backup systems that do not rely on GPS as they are helpful in the event of an issue, or if the GPS connection fails. Finally, practice good cyber hygiene, when not needed GPS servers and equipment should be kept offline, passwords should be changed regularly and virus protection, firewalls and cyber defence practices should all be implemented.

            <h2>Lack of Spatial Awareness</h2>
            <p>
                GPS causes over-reliance on technology which has led to a decline in traditional navigational skills and spatial awareness. Consequences of the reduce in spatial memory and awareness can cause lack in independence and mobility and implications in our ability to perform tasks that involve these skills such as reading maps, playing sports and navigating a new city. Creating a ‘spatial map’ in your mind allows you to identify new routes and shortcuts, whereas a step by step navigation does not allow for flexibility or learning in an environment. In a study done on pilots by the ‘International Journal of Applied Aviation’, the study found that the navigational awareness of pilots appeared to be significantly lower when flying with GPS and map displays, this information is alarming as it raises questions of the spatial awareness of pilots in the case of an emergency.

            <p>
                To help fix the issue of spatial awareness caused by the over reliance on GPS and technology, it is encouraged to engage in activities that require spatial thinking such as puzzles and technology. Although unavoidable in new places, it is encouraged to use a physical map and only use a GPS navigation system when absolutely necessary to encourage exploration and self – independence.
