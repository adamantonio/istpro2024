            <h2>Feature Technology</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Online banking</strong>, also known as <em>internet/electronic banking</em>, describes the financial transactions between customers and distributors through an online medium. Introduced in <em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-brief-history-of-digital-banking">1994</a></em>, it is highly vital to current day advancing lifestyles as it allows individuals to connect and purchase goods from one another, negating any geographical barriers whilst retaining convenience. The main aim of online banking is to increase convenience and efficiency through abolishing the need for physical visits to the bank, saving a lot of time. More than <em>80%</em> of Australians utilise online banking due to its rewarding features entailing: quick transactions, lower transaction costs, accessibility, and a reduced chance for error, affirming its vitality in society. Online banking allows customers to transfer funds instantly, saving time and reducing human error when using the fully automated online service. Additionally, due to its low costs and <em>24/7</em> access time, online banking is extremely popular and often referred to as the <em>‘cheapest method of transacting’</em>. Due to its high effectivity for account management and fund transfers, many people turn to the more convenient and effective alternative.</p>
            <p>
                Online banking requires a range of software and hardware, including an access point (either an app or portal), security measures (such as encryption, firewalls, and fraud detection), and a physical device (a phone/laptop). Services for online aid are usually situated over phone or emails, through screen control/sharing software. Popular products associated with online banking communications are usually provided through banks such as <em>Commonwealth</em> and <em>HSBC</em>, along with sharing apps such as <em><a href="https://anydesk.com/en-au">AnyDesk</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en-au/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=au%7Cb%7Cpr%7C22%7Cjun%7Ctv-core-brand-only-exact-sn%7Cfree%7Ct0%7C0&utm_content=Exact&utm_term=teamviewer&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2PSvBhDjARIsAKc2cgMe9eHm0KW2FC7Gjuq1Qi0JxlgpEiYaatLqGxeo6cYcQFWuQ-Q9V54aAt5FEALw_wcB">TeamViewer</a></em>.
            </p>
            <p>Steps in a online transaction:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A login and authentication, usually requiring users to enter a username and password/pin, and occasionally any additional verification (such as security questions or one-time passwords).</li>
                <li>Users are prompted with an account selection which they can use to transfer, deposit, withdraw, and etcetera. </li>
                <li>User provides the details of the transaction and completes any necessary security measures which are then processed by the online banking system.</li>
                <li>Transaction is confirmed, and the account is updated. </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Online banking has proved a profound impact on both society and individuals, transcending the experience and convenience of banking. With the introduction of online banking since <em>1994</em>, banking institutions, businesses, and consumers have had the most benefits due to the rewarding features. Through its online presence, the technology has improved the efficiency and convenience of banking, compared to the past methods of visiting a physical bank with long wait times just to view a balance. Of the adult Australians who use the internet, more than <em>85%</em> of them use online banking, displaying its significance to both the financial and social aspects of individual lives. Furthermore, online banking has been contributing greatly to the economy through financial inclusion to rural areas, e-commerce payment solutions, and productivity within companies. The digitisation of banking has allowed remote areas with limited access to a physical bank, significantly contribute to economy by providing quick, convenient, and efficient access. Furthermore the growth of e-commerce has further enhanced the economy, through increased desirable services of quick payment solutions. Companies have also gained productive access to more capital through online banking, as transactions are easier to execute even for large orders.</p>

            <h3>Online Banking Trojans</h3>
            <p>
                With the heavy reliance on online banking, many legal, ethical, and social issues have risen out of the technology. A main concern is the online banking trojan which raises all issues by utilising fake and malicious software geared to steal sensitive financial details. The online banking trojan operates stealthily without the users knowledge by beginning with a prompt from fake emails, websites, or text messages. The downloaded trojan then monitors and key logs any data such as login credentials, account numbers, and etcetera. These trojans primarily raise a legal issue so any form of malicious software geared to stealing information are prohibited through jurisdictions. Online banking trojans breach law through unauthorised access to computer systems, thievery of sensitive online information, fraudulent transactions, privacy violations, and numerous others, describing the depth and severity of the crime. Additionally, trojans are also known to raise a social concern through the impact on both individual and community lives. The main impact of these crimes are seen through the victims financial state, where the impact is translated to social lives through stress, insecurity, and hardship. Communities may also suffer from economic repercussions as trojans cause individuals to lose trust in each other and banking institutions. Consequently, online banking trojans are also a major ethical issue through the massive breaching of trust, exploitation of vulnerable peoples, and violation of privacy. Not only is it morally wrong to commit an online banking trojan, but it is also a violation of basic human rights.</p>

            <h3>Online Banking Phishing</h3>
            <p>
                Similarly, phishing attacks have risen by <em>61%</em> since 2021, with online banking related incidents contributing to the rising number. Such attacks are executed through hacking previously trusted addresses and sending a message to fool victims into providing sensitive information. Phishing attacks are extremely devastating to victims due to the high difficulty with spotting such attacks as hackers often communicate in a personal basis. An example of this detrimental crime can be seen through one of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/15/tim-was-scammed-out-of-222000-he-says-the-bank-should-have-to-give-his-money-back">The Guardian articles</a></em>, shedding light to Tim Watkin’s experience with an attack. A text message was sent to him stating a <em>withdrawal from his account</em> which he did not make, leading to a number of calls and instructions to <em>‘protect’</em> his account. Through these instructions, Tim lost <em>$220 000</em> over the course of <em>10 transactions</em> due to his mistake in providing personal information to what he thought was the bank but merely a hacker. With Tim being one of the many Australians who have fallen victim to online banking phishing scams, the prominence of the scams is extremely relevant and raises all legal, social, and ethical issues. </p>

            <h3>Online Banking Keylogging</h3>
            <p> 
                Keylogging attacks have also accumulated since the rise of online banking which uniquely steals sensitive information through recording keystrokes. The malware is first installed obliviously by the user, then keylogging any keystrokes in the background to send to the attacker. Keylogging is often covered up to avoid detection through various techniques including routing through internet traffic or anonymous services. The crime is considered illegal across many countries and offenders may be charged with fines and imprisonment. Additionally, keylogging removes trust in opening attachments despite possible authenticity. This creates an atmosphere of distrust, with users not knowing which messages to trust and which to not trust. A famous example of a keylogging attack includes the attempted heist of <em>229 million pounds</em> from <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/04/sumitomo-fraud-attempt">Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in September of 2004</a></em>. Through downloading keylogging software onto banking systems, hackers almost managed to set a new record for most amount of money stolen through a cyber-attack. Despite the failed attempt, its closeness to almost succeeding highlights the gravity of keylogging attacks in online banking. </p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
                All users can positively contribute to the growth and associations of online banking, making sure that it is a safe and trusting environment. Users should respect and not outwardly harm others, using the platform for the appropriate and intended uses. Additionally, education and understanding of what online banking crimes and scams look like would further enhance and protect users. This could be done through provided information sessions, online resources, educational materials, and close collaborations with banks. This approach should be utilised for online banking trojans, phishing, keylogging, and numerous other crimes for prevention.</p>
            <p>For peoples that are suspecting a possible scam, it is important to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stop communication with possible attacker</li>
                <li>Refuse providing sensitive information</li>
                <li>Alert bank for possible scam</li>
                <li>Report the scam to <em><a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam">Scam Watch</a></em></li>
                <li>Warn others of possible scams</li>
                <li>Seek support from experts</li>
                <li>Stay informed for how to deal with scam</li>
                <li>Review account activity for suspicious activity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
Additionally measures such as changing passwords and information could further negate and reduce the impact of the attempted/suspected scam. Besides that, users can continue to use online banking technologies appropriately for its many benefits whilst being aware of the potential dangers.</p>
