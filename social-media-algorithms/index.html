            <h2>Features of Social Media Algorithms</h2>
            <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Social media algorithms leverage machine learning to analyse massive amounts of data and predict the content that would most appeal to you. This analysis happens in several layers: 
            </p>

            <h4>1. Patterns in Individual Usage</h4> 
            
            <p>
                Specifically, algorithms analyse your interactions such as the likes you’ve left, comments you wrote, what kind of posts you shared and your searches to identify patterns. This can include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Identifying your interests: Algorithms cast posts into different categories based on the medium (video, text, or image), content (space, sports, animals) and so much more. By reviewing the data gathered of which type of posts you interact the most with, social media is able to prioritise them in your feed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analysing your connections: The people you connect with on social media; ultimately impacts your feed as well. This is because the algorithm prioritises content from accounts you follow and those you interact with through comments, likes, and shares; creating a personalised feed that reflects your existing social circles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cataloguing your changes in sentiment: By analysing the tone of language you use in comments and posts, the algorithm can even identify your shifts in opinion on a particular issue, and thus is able to adjust to your changing interests.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img src="https://idapgroup.com/blog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.jpg" alt = "all components of individual usage">

            <h4>2. Analysing Overall Trends</h4>
            <p>In the end, it is not only your behavioural statistics that affect your experience on social media. It is also the ‘hot’ trends and ‘popular’ creators that make it onto your feed as well. The algorithm is able to detect these through:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Topic modelling: Algorithms can automatically identify the main themes and topics discussed within posts. This helps categorise content and track the prevalence of specific topics over time, and also to a degree affects what ends up on your screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Image and video recognition: Machine learning can recognize objects, scenes, and even emotions within images and videos. This allows the algorithm to identify emerging trends related to specific visuals (like memes).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Social media platforms have a wealth of information about how users are connected. Machine learning can analyse this social graph to understand which creators spark huge amounts of engagement – and thus may potentially spark yours too. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            </figure>
            
            <h4>3. Real-time Analysis and Feedback Loop:</h4>
            <p>
                Machine learning allows for continuous analysis of data. As new information comes in, the algorithm can adjust its predictions and refine its understanding of emerging trends. This creates a feedback loop where user behaviour and content creation inform the prediction of future trends
            </p>

            
            <h3>A/B Testing</h3>
            <p>
                The next step after analysing all the different factors that contribute to your feed and predicting how you would react to certain content, people, trends and creators – is of course, testing which you subconsciously prioritise. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Platforms often conduct A/B testing, where they show different versions of a feed to different users to see which one generates more engagement. This looks like Version A prioritising content from friends and family, while Version B prioritises content from trending topics. Having created these 2 options; the algorithm then shows Version A to a random group of users and Version B to another random group. They are able to see which version appeals more to the widest range of users (through, again, an extreme variety of metrics), and are able to identify and adapt to the features that resonate best with them.

            <h2>Purpose of Social Media Algorithms</h2>
            <p>
                So, why bother making social media so complicated? Why analyse overall statistics and bring creators and trends that don't even fit the interests your data indicated into your feed? And what's the point of knowing what’s trending or not anyway?
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as social media companies may talk about “personalising your experience to better suit you”, in the end it all comes down to money. 
            </p>

            <blockquote class='right'>
                "As a company whose business is attention... You're in the business of keeping people glued to the site."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Social media companies are unable to make money off of user interactions alone. They rely on exposure to advertisement to generate profit. As a result, the social media algorithm is designed to know all your interests, and to expose you to popular trends and creators – as it will keep you glued to the platform.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Algorithms targets specific demographics with the most relevant ads – which is why if you search up makeup on Tik Tok, you get ads sponsored by cosmetic companies. This means you’re more likely to buy the products, which generates revenue for the platform.
            </p>

            <h2>Existing Products</h2>
            <p>
                Social media algorithms, at its basis, is ‘algorithms’ but adapted to their purpose. As a result, there are many other existing products that use the base ‘algorithm’ for their own cause. These other existing uses include:
            </p>

            <h3>In E-commerce and Retail</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Recommendation Engines: Online stores like Amazon use algorithms to recommend products or shows you might be interested in based on your purchase history and browsing behaviour (i.e what products do you pause at the most)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dynamic Pricing: Algorithms can be used to adjust product prices based on demand and competitor pricing. This makes it easier for retailers to attract customers, without losing too much money in the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fraud Detection: E-commerce platforms use algorithms to analyse purchase patterns. This is able to identify fraudulent transactions before they happen. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>In Streaming Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Content Curation: Streaming services like Spotify use algorithms to curate personalised playlists and recommend new music based on your listening habits. This includes recommending artists with similar styles, or songs with similar rhythms. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adaptive Bitrate Streaming: Surprisingly, the quality of your video is also calculated by algorithms. They are adjusted based on your internet connection speed, ensuring the best quality videos without overloading your network.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>
                    Ride-sharing Apps: Even ride-sharing apps utilise algorithms to function. Algorithms match riders with drivers, considering factors like location, demand, and estimated travel time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Route Optimization: Navigation apps use algorithms to analyse traffic patterns. They use this data to suggest the fastest or most fuel-efficient routes for drivers, depending on their prioritisation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars are completely reliant on advanced algorithms to navigate roads, perceive their surroundings, and make real-time decisions based on the data gathered from its environment.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Associated Hardware and Software</h2>

            <p>
                Because of all the complicated details of the algorithm; you may have already guessed that it probably takes more than lines of code on a computer for it to work. So, what physical and soft components factor into the algorithm’s functionality? 
            </p>

            <h3>Hardware associated with algorithms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Data Centres: Social media algorithms need immense storage space to store the data it collects, generate ever-changing trends and to create these personalised feeds. Thus, these centres are used to house the vast amount of data used to train and run algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    High-Performance Computing Servers: Merely storing the data isn't enough to generate millions of personalised feeds, predict engagement levels (i.e future trends) and allocate them accordingly. Servers are physical computer systems with tangible components like processors, memory, storage drives, and network interfaces. These components work together to store, process and analyse the data used by social media algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Graphics Processing Units (GPUs): GPUs are commonly used in machine learning due to their ability to accelerate tasks using their parallel processing capabilities. As social media algorithms rely almost completely on machine learning and its speed; GPUs are essential to its efficiency and effectiveness.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img src ="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:900/1*Zdw6rMDZLtBVzYZQ1oljIA.jpeg" alt ="GPU">

            <h3>Software associated with algorithms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Machine Learning Frameworks: Software frameworks such as TensorFlow or Pytorch to provide the building blocks for developing and training machine learning models that power social media algorithms. These frameworks build and train machine learning models.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Big Data Analytics Tools: Social media platforms generate massive amounts of data, which needs some kind of software to analyse. Tools like Apache Hadoop or Spark help store, manage, and analyse this data to identify patterns and user behaviour trends. They are then stored within servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programming Languages: Lastly, coding languages like Python and R are needed to create, develop and implement machine learning algorithms for social media platforms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): An API is essentially a set of instructions and protocols that define how applications communicate with each other. It allows different parts of the social media platform to communicate with each other and exchange data. ​​
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impacts on Individuals</h2>

            <p>
                Algorithms have such a large grasp on our online life, and in some instances, shapes the information we receive on social media platforms. So, what does its power and seeming omniscience mean for us?
            </p>

            <h3>Positive Individual Impacts</h3>

            <ul>
                
                <blockquote class='right'>
                    "Facebook is a discovery model platform. Its primary goal is to make the audience happy."
                </blockquote>

                <li>
                    <u>Personalised Experience and Enjoyment:</u> Imagine wading through an endless stream of irrelevant posts just to find one you enjoy. With algorithms, you are exposed to a steady flow of content filtered to your personal tastes, instead of you having to scroll endlessly to find content that interests you or even manually update criteria whenever your interests shift. This, obviously, increases personal happiness in the short term.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Discovery and Community Building:</u> Social media algorithms introduce you to new ideas and people you wouldn't have found otherwise. Recommendation systems can expose you to music, creators, or news sources you might not have known about, thus broadening your horizons. Similarly, algorithms can connect you with online communities that share your interests, fostering a sense of belonging and facilitating connections between like-minded individuals.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>

                    <u>Addiction and Attention Spans:</u> Social media platforms are designed to be addictive, with features like infinite scrolling and attention-grabbing notifications. Algorithms exploit this by prioritising content that keeps you engaged for longer periods, so that they would make more profit. However, this impacts your ability to focus and shortens your attention span in the long term
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Dr. Gloria Mark, a University of California, Irvine professor, has conducted studies suggesting a decline in attention spans for online tasks. Her research shows a decrease in the average time people spend on a single screen before switching attention (from 2.5 minutes in 2004 to less than a minute in recent years). This decrease may be attributed to the prevalence of social media algorithms on our screens.
                        </li>

                <li>
                    <u>Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers:</u> While you may interact with communities with similar interests and viewpoints as you; it could very quickly turn into echo chambers where you are only exposed to information and people who confirm your biases. This increases the chance of becoming polarised in your ideals, reduces your capacity for critical thinking and limits your understanding of the world.

            <h2>Impacts on Society</h2>

            <p>
                Just like how algorithms determine what’s best for us by taking into account the overall trends of all users; we should examine the effect of social media algorithms on society if we were to accurately pass judgement on its impacts on us.
            </p>

            <h3>Positive Societal Impacts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><u>Enhancing Social Movements:</u></strong> Social media algorithms are powerful tools for social good. By connecting people facing similar challenges or those passionate about a cause, algorithms can amplify marginalised voices and create entire social movements. The MeToo movement consisting of women speaking out against similar experiences in sexual assault wouldn’t have gained the traction it had without the algorithm bringing those people together. This is as sharing experiences, opening up to one another, and organising activities become easier when connected with others who share something in common.	
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong><u>Small Business Promotion and Advocacy:</u></strong> For small businesses, social media algorithms give them the chance to stand out. By targeting potential customers based on demographics and interests, algorithms can help small businesses reach their target audience more effectively. Smaller businesses can compete with larger companies more than ever before for brand awareness and customer engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><u>Economic Opportunities:</u></strong> On a broader scale, social media algorithms can similarly connect businesses with potential customers based on common interest; create new economic opportunities through elevating ‘micro-influencers’ and empower entrepreneurs by giving them a platform to showcase their ideas to a wider range of investors.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Negative Societal Impacts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><u>Spread of misinformation and hate speech:</u></strong> The purpose of algorithms is to bring money to the platform. The more you interact with it, the more money it brings. Thus, social media algorithms can amplify the spread of false information and hateful content due to their focus on engagement. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong><u>Manipulation and control:</u></strong> Algorithms can be used to manipulate public opinion or control behaviour. The targeted advertising it was built to amplify can exploit psychological vulnerabilities to influence people's choices and actions. It also leaves loopholes for other actors to use its lax regulations for bad actions.
                    <ul>
                        <blockquote class='left'>

                            An example is the 2016 US presidential election, where Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, harvested Facebook data to target voters with personalised political messaging, potentially influencing the election outcome.

                            Not only that, a 2022 report by Freedom House found that 80% of all countries in the world assessed demonstrated some level of governmental manipulation in social media, influencing the opinons and actions of civilians.

                So, how much of what we think is from ourselves, and how much is from what algorithms have influenced us to think?

        <h2>Social, Ethical and Legal Concerns</h2>

        <p>
            To understand the full extent of what a piece of technology means for our lives; we need to fully delve into the social, ethical and legal concerns it may pose.
        </p>

        <h3>Social Concerns</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Addiction:</u></strong> The algorithm also uses a variable reward system, where you get unpredictable positive reinforcement (i.e likes, comments) for your actions (i.e posting, sharing). This, along with the fact that the algorithm tailors your experience for you, keeps you engaged and coming back for more, potentially leading to addiction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Mental health issues:</u></strong> Algorithms often personalise feeds to show users content that depict perfect and exciting lifestyles, in order to market an advertisement to you. Excessive exposure to this leads to social comparison, making users feel inadequate or left out, which fuels feelings of depression and anxiety. A 2016 study published in Computers in Human Behavior found a positive correlation between social media addiction and symptoms of depression and anxiety.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Algorithmic Bias:</u></strong> Algorithms often used to analyse data over a long time don’t consider the other factors contributing to the trend. Thus, algorithms can reflect the biases present in the circumstances of the data they are trained on, leading to discriminatory outcomes. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In fact, a 2016 ProPublica investigation revealed racial bias in a risk assessment algorithm used in the criminal justice system. The algorithm was more likely to incorrectly label black defendants as high risk for recommitting compared to white defendants. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Similarly, a 2020 report by the Algorithmic Justice League found that facial recognition software used by law enforcement has a false positive rate of up to 34% for Black Americans, compared to a 0% error rate for white men. This doesn’t take into the account the racial bias in police arrests.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="https://www.internetandtechnologylaw.com/files/2020/11/AI-Bias.jpg" alt = "algorithmic bias">

        <p>
            In this way, the use of algorithms can lead to unfair outcomes in areas like criminal justice, loan approvals, or even job applications; often exacerbating existing social inequalities.
        </p>

        <h3>Legal Concerns</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <blockquote class='right'>
                    "Privacy is not something that you just give up; it's something that's stripped away from you."
                </blockquote>
                
                <strong><u>Privacy Laws:</u></strong> Algorithms rely on vast amounts of personal data to function. And this raises the questions of: Just how much of our privacy is being invaded? Do platforms really have a legal right to all our information? At the same time, there are many risks regarding the misuse of personal information stored in these algorithms, and the lax laws around data collection. Not only is it a violation of privacy, but a misuse of data altogether.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For example, the app Pinduoduo. In 2020, reports emerged that the app was collecting a vast amount of user data beyond what was necessary for its core functionality, which was an e-commerce platform. This included phone numbers, contact lists, browsing history from other apps, and even facial recognition data. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Similar violations of privacy and user rights have happened on apps utilising algorithms, such as the Cambridge Analytica Data Scandal in the 2010s. A British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica illegally collected the personal data of millions of Facebook users through an app called “This is Your Digital Life”. It used the data of 87 million users for political advertising during the 2016 election. Not only privacy laws, this scandal sparked conversations about the potential impact of algorithms on our very elections.

            <h2>Recommendation</h2>
            <p>
                In the end, what can we do to stop all this harm? Here are some laws and regulations of other countries aimed to combat the specific harms of social media algorithms that we could take inspiration from.
            </p>

            <h3>Transparency and Privacy</h3>

            <p>
                The European Union: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives users more control over their personal data and how it's used by social media platforms. This includes the right to access the data collected about them and the right to object to the automated decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>Echo Chambers</h3>
            <p>
                No country have passed a law specifically like this yet to counter the rise of echo chambers. In order to balance the creation of close knit communities centered around one interest, and that community becoming polarised over time: social media companies could promote algorithmic diversity along with uniformity at specific intervals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of solely focusing on maximizing engagement, this new algorithm could incorporate metrics that promote exposure to diverse viewpoints and factual information. This involves showcasing content from a wider range of sources, even if it generates slightly less engagement initially. If the use of both algorithms are balanced, this would lead to a better online world.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Misinformation and Hate Speech</h3>

            <p>
                Germany: The Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) requires social media platforms to remove hateful content and defamatory posts within 24 hours after receiving a report. This puts pressure on platforms to develop algorithms that can effectively identify and flag such content.
