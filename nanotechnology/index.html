            <h2>What is nanotechnology?</h2>
            <p>
                According to the <a href="https://www.nano.gov/about-nanotechnology">National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI)</a> “nanotechnology is the <em>understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale</em>, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometres”. It is said that biological properties of matter can be displayed at a nanoscale, which  is different from properties of single atoms, molecules, and bulk materials.

            <p>
                Compared to other forms or sizes of the same materials, nanostructured materials are often stronger or have different magnetic properties while others are better at conducting heat or electricity. Nanomaterials can also become more reflective of light, chemically reactive or change colours as their structure and/or size is altered.

            <h3>How small is nano?</h3>
            <p>The prefix “nano” means one billionth or 10<sup>-9</sup> in the <em>International System of Units</em>, which is one billionth of a meter. The unit for nanometer is <strong>nm</strong>. To make is easier to visualise it, a sheet of paper is 100,000 nanometres thick, and a human hair is around 50,000 to 100,000 nanometres in diameter. </p>

            <h2>Products made using Nanotechnology</h2>
            
            <h3>Sunscreen</h3>
            <p>Over the years, nanoparticles have been added to sunscreen to make them more effective. Two of the most commonly added nanoparticles are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. These tiny particles make a great addition to sunscreen as it is not only highly effective at blocking UV radiation, but it also feels lighter on the skin. This is why present-day sunscreen is nowhere as thick and tacky as it was in the past. </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Clothing</h3>
            <p>Fabrics that repel water and other liquids can be created with the help nanoparticles of silica. In textiles, the silica that is added to the fabric is either sprayed onto the surface or incorporated into the fabric’s weave to create a stainproof or waterproof coating. Thanks to nanotechnology, when liquid comes in contact with waterproof clothing, it simply forms little water droplets that roll off rather than being absorbed. </p>

            <h2>Types of Nanomaterials</h2>
            <p>Natural nanomaterials naturally occur in the world, which include the particles that make up smoke or volcanic ash. These can also include some molecules in our bodies, for example the haemoglobin in our blood. Another example is a peacock’s feathers, which are a result of spacing between nanometer-scale structures on the surface. </p>

            <p>Nanotechnology is a very vast field that includes a wide range of technologies at a nano scale. Some fields include pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, genomics, neuroscience, robotics, etc. Since nanotechnology is still very new, there are global debates about risk regulation and international cooperation. </p>
            <p>The potential risks with nanoparticles and nanotechnology have been acknowledged by regulatory bodies around the world. Starting from 2004, the European Union are in the process of developing a regulatory policy which will tighten control. This will also improve knowledge about the risks of nanotechnology. As of today, provisions have been introduced on nanomaterials. These were mainly introduced for biocides, cosmetics, food additives, food labelling, etc. </p>

            <p>Nanoparticles are danger for many reasons. One of which is that nanoparticles may damage a person’s lungs when breathed in. This is because of the size of these particles and also because of the chemically they carry, such as metals or hydrocarbons. Studies have shown that some nanoparticles can cause lung damage in rats. While other studies show that nanoparticles can lead to brain damage in fish and dogs.

            <p>A big issue is that it is nearly impossible to know if a product or substance contains nanoparticles because these are not required to be labelled under the current legislation. Due to their small size, nanomaterials interact with humans in different ways than normal materials. </p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            
            <h3>Improving knowledge base</h3>

            <figure>
                <img src="https://s29814.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_1847661151.jpg.optimal.jpg" alt="an open book with a lighbulb and ther symbols coming out of it">

                    <em>Nanotechnology is a new field which people are yet to learn more about</em>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <blockquote class='left'>
                Fun fact 9: The oldest form of nanotechnology can be dated back to fourth century AD by the Romans
            </blockquote>

            <p>Nanotechnology is a rapidly growing industry that include many people working to advance the science and to develop the applications of it. However, resource or information gaps need to be a subject of focus, especially for funding agencies. </p>
            
            <h3>Understanding of Risks</h3>

            <figure>
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/riskacademy.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Risk.png?fit=2152%2C1146&ssl=1" alt="a risks scale, ranging from low to high">
                <figcaption>
                    <em>Risks should be assessed for appropriate warning and monitoring systems to be developed</em>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>A majority of the public and private investment in research and development (R&D) funds should go towards a better understanding of the risks, especially in the production, application exposure or disposal of nanomaterials and products. This involves characterising the risks, while also assessing and managing them.  The knowledge gaps that exist today need to be closed and fast and responsive warning and monitoring systems should also be developed. </p>
            
            <h3>Broadening Social Benefits and Acceptance</h3>

            <figure>
                <img src="https://cdn.vocab.com/units/ilzl5hfg/feature.png?width=500&v=16eeb347880" alt="many people standing around the globe">
                <figcaption>
                    <em>Society should learn more about the risks of nanotechnology and the future implications of it</em>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>As society learns more and more about nanotechnology and the potential risks associated with it, discussions about exploring the social and moral implications of future innovations should be broadened. There are applications that has the ability to offer universal benefits, such as life-saving medical treatments, however these may be inaccessible due to the cost, especially for those struggling financially.  Solutions to social challenges such as water treatments or energy generation can potentially be solved through nanotechnology. However, if these applications are not widely shared across the globe, the split between developed and developing nations will only grow larger. </p>
            
            <h4>The public’s interest</h4>

            <figure>

                    <em>The benefits of the public should be put prioritised</em>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The investment in research and development fund should be aimed at wider social applications, especially towards the benefit of the public. </p>
            
            <h4>Developing countries</h4>

            <figure>
                <img src="https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Countries-Have-Outgrown-the-Terms-22Developed22-and-22Developing22-scaled.jpg" alt="a vintage world map with different currencies around it">
                <figcaption>
                    <em>Applications of nanotechnology should be made more affordable for developing countries</em>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>For nanotechnology’s benefits to be shared globally, new approaches to intellectual property rights need to be considered. To many developing countries, applications of nanotechnology with have significant benefits, such as the need for clean drinking water. Through this, access to nanotechnology applications will be made more affordable. </p>
