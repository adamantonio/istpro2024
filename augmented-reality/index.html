            <h2>What it is? How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                Augmented Reality is a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user’s view of the real world, thus providing a composite view. The futuristic interactive experience that enhances the real world with computer generated perceptual information. Through the use of software apps, hardware and products, Augmented reality has taken its first big steps towards creating change and overlap digital content onto real-life environment and objects. For you folks, it will provide a heighted immersive experience as the computer generates visual elements, sound and other stimuli that will bring a ton of surprises and enjoyment.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I guess you’re wondering how Augmented reality work? Well it’s actually quite simple but complicated at the same time. It starts with a camera-equipped device (e.g. Smartphone, tablet or smart glasses – loaded with AR software) which analyses a video feed to identify physical objects or the environment around the user, such as an object or layout of a location. As the user moves/points the device and looks at an object, the software recognizes it through the vision technology and analyses the video stream. 
            </p>

                    Technology will continue to <a href="https://bernardmarr.com/the-10-biggest-technology-trends-that-will-transform-the-next-decade/">change everything</a>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>To outline the rollcall of how this technology works, it can be simplified into these few points:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It firstly and definitely requires <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> to work: allowing users to complete actions using voice prompts and other actions – it also acts as a vital factor, as AI processes information for the application in AR</li>
                <li>It then consists of Software: which are tools and applications used to access AR; many businesses choose to create their own personalised form; however they are all pretty similar to each other.</li>
                <li>A processor is also needed, Augmented Reality need processing power to work. It coordinates and analyses inputs, stores and retrieves data which leads to the generation of outputs (appropriate display)</li>
                <li>Lenses are a platform to view the content generated (3-dimensional). The higher quality means the more ‘real’ it will appear to the user</li>
                <li>Sensors are used to digest data about their environment to align the real and digital worlds. ‘When the camera captures information, it sends it though software for processing.’ (Microsoft, 2023) </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Augmented really cannot exist in one system, commonly its realistically part of a cloud connected <a href="https://pluto-men.com/how-augmented-reality-fits-into-industry-40/#:~:text=AR%20supports%20Industry%204.0%20by,to%20increased%20efficiency%20in%20manufacturing.">‘industry 4.0 ecosystem</a> that incorporates everything from big data to automated robots’ (SAP, 2023). </p>
            
            <p>It works through information being downloaded about an object from the cloud, similar to the way web browsers load via a URL. However the difference is that Augmented reality’s information is presented through a 3D/virtual experience overlaid on reality environments rather than a digital screen.</p>
            
            <h2>Differences between other similar technologies</h2>
            <p>So if you’re like me, you would be thinking about what the actual differences are between all these new complicated Artificial intelligence technologies. The ones that sounds particularly similar to Augmented reality but are actually quite different in its purpose are: Virtual reality (known as VR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Augmented reality consists of adding digital elements over real world view with limited interactions</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a> is entirely an immersive experience isolating users from real world, usually via headset device and microphone.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/au/products/substance3d/discover/mixed-reality.html#:~:text=Mixed%20reality%20(MR)%20is%20an,world%20for%20mixed%20reality%20experiences.">Mixed Reality</a> is the combination of AR and VR, when digital objects can interact with the real world. An example is when products have designs that incorporate elements anchored within a real environment</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/extended-reality-xr">Extended Reality</a> is the combination of all types of technology, including the 3 above </li>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of Augmented reality cannot be easily described within a few words. As it’s something that’s so new and rapidly changing day-by-day, all we can conclude is that it will change our lives more, as time passes and new developments become present to our lives. However the stages that society has reached upon today, is the enrichment of user’s experience, turning one’s immediate surroundings into an interactive learning environment which is particularly valuable in manufacturing. It has the ability to take one into another world, without complicated barriers, makes visual changes to a natural environment thus enhancing it, to align with user’s request.
            </p>


            <h2>Hardware and Software</h2>
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>
                Within the hardware of Augmented Reality, features like sensors, input devices, and displays make up the most important part of AR. Sensors are a vital piece of hardware Augmented Reality use, which can be seen by different representation of: cameras, accelerometers and gyroscopes. Examples of different types of sensors include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/wp/sloa190b/sloa190b.pdf?ts=1711257569948&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">Light of flight (TOF) cameras</a></li>

                Input devices can be depicted as touchscreens and controllers – there is a wide range available, but classification is usually distinctions can be done through accuracy or range. Also there are discrete inputs that include one-time event (mouse button or pinch glove).
            </p>
            <p>
                Displays are mostly seen as head-mounted devices (also known as headsets) which can be used to show optic and image displays. An example product of this can be the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-lens-google-glass/">‘Minimal google GLASS’</a> and the <a href="https://www.vive.com/au/product/">‘Fully immersive HTC Vive’</a>.

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>
            Many different companies’ products use innovative original software or integrates other’s popular used software that are digitized from trusted funds. Some best Augmented Reality software development platforms include: Google, Apple, Spark, Vuforia, Adobe and many more. Many can simply just be a starter kit/basis for adding more original elements and publishment. But most commonly, Adobe Aero is the choice for designers and developers, as it’s an all-in-one combination authoring and viewing platform.

            <h2>Effects on an Individuals and Society</h2>
            <p>
                The effects of Augmented reality on individuals and society can be very easily ignored by many. Yet, it is so important for us to at least minimal knowledge and understanding of it, thus, to accept that no technology is perfect in all dimensions and have no flaws. 
            </p>

            <h3>Impacts on Individuals </h3>
            <p>
                On individuals, the effects may vary for users due to their demographic, socioeconomic status and differed factors. So to start off, a positive effect Augmented technology has on some disadvantaged individuals, is the ability to support with special needs and to enable their development of daily living skills. For disabilities such as: intellectual disability, autism, down syndrome, hearing disability etc. Augmented reality can really make a difference in their life. Augmented reality can also be a <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1306555.pdf">learning enhancement</a> tool, by making education an interactive and vastly more visual which is more memorable and engaging for most learners. Additionally, technology is also an effective tool in sparking one’s imagination and to express in a more affordable manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the contrary side, Augmented reality on an individual that lack self-control and prone to unsubordinated behaviour, can have many life-threatening negative effects. These effects mainly surrounds <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10199391/">health issues</a>, for example like eye-irritation and visual fatigue. This may be delivered through symptoms that are caused from prolonged exposure to Augmented reality content. Moreover, as AR is still fairly new technology, some long-term health issues are still under concerns. But in more common circumstances, physical injuries may arise from loss of awareness of real-world surroundings, for instance like users walking into traffic, falling over obstacles or other accidents. Some psychological damage on individuals consists of addiction and overreliance on AR technology. The engaging aspects may lead to users spending excessive amounts of time which potentially may impact real-world social interactions, mental health and quality of wellbeing.
            </p>

            <h3>Impacts on Society </h3>
            
            <p>
                For society, Augmented reality has actually caused some very serious effects positively but specifically negatively. In many circumstances, it has breached legal, ethical and social factors that effected society in many environments. When facing legal and regulatory laws, Augmented reality must be aware and set boundaries upon <a href="https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2017/march/13/intellectual-property-rights-in-a-virtual-world#:~:text=The%20basic%20legal%20position%20on,permission%20from%20the%20owner%20of">intellectual property rights</a>, privacy laws and matters involving content regulations and censorship. However some parts can be quite misogynistic, due to the combination of digital content with physical world leading to complications upon permission, rights and ownership. For example, AR has challenged many Intellectual property copyright ownerships, this is because AR is built through using database information from the real-world, thus the databased may also be protected by copyright.

            </figure>
            <p>
                In other cases, Augmented reality has created upon ethical issues mainly targeted upon developers’ authenticity and risks of misinformation. Many developers struggle to prioritize authenticity and precision of their consent, which builds upon the spread of incorrect information and social consequences. When advertising, Augmented reality challenges the sustainable balance between immersive advertisement while respecting user autonomy. For example, Pokémon Go faced huge criticism for its unethical use of personal data, tracking customer location without clear consent. Additionally, Augmented reality introduced social isolation and erosion of human relationships, isolating one from society. This leads to the estimation of ‘decline in face-to-face communication and community engagement’ (NSFLOW, 2023)

            <p>
                To lighten up the mood of this article, there are actually many positive aspects from Augmented reality impact on society. First of all, AR enhances communication and social engagement (due to accessibility from a majority of societies). As of any location that has access to internet connection, everyone will be able to have a more insightful and incredible experience working with AR. Another positive impact from Augmented reality is the ability to reduce design, production, and maintenance costs – based of the reduction of interruptions during the production process. For example, AR can guide its own mechanics in assembling engines with scarce errors and high productivity. Not only is it efficient, it also can alert workers from undertaking dangerous action when working in hazardous areas, thus reduces the risks of accidents.

            <h2>Recommendations for Improvement</h2>
            <p>
                For products, services and societal movements related to Augmented reality, they should collaborate with national governments, international bodies and stakeholders in improving a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework that would insist on having a safer AR technology use globally.
            </p>
            <p>
                To prevent individuals from over-using AR technology, devices should implement use-time (screen time) restrictions, this includes by restricting and implementing legal outlines for any AR products that are being designed to address time usage. For fortunate individuals, they should have the choice and encouragement to undergo user education and training, this would allow users to develop a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities, limitations and potential risks from Augmented reality use. 
            </p>
            <blockquote class='left'>
                “AR is like that. It will be that dramatic" - Tim Cook CEO of Apple
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The process of discovering, analysing and strategizing issues caused from Augmented reality will take decent period of time, however what will support the constant improvement is the ability for society and communities to accept the downsides and issues caused by AR. Paired with, continuous monitoring and evaluation, there should be on-going adjustment of policies and strategies, but this will be a sustaining method for continuous improvement working towards a better and sustainable use of Augmented Reality.
