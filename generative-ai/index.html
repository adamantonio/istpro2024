            <h2>What really is Generative AI?</h2>
            
            <blockquote class='right'>
                Generative AI focuses on creating new and original content, chat responses, designs, synthetic data or even deepfakes.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence which utilizes inputs in order to generate various forms of content, such as images, texts, sounds, and animations. Generative AI makes use of machine learning, trained to recognize patterns and structures from extremely large datasets in order to form new content. Different learning approaches can be used to obtain this result:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Supervised Learning:
                    <div>The algorithm predicts the labels of data by comparing them to an existing set of training data that have already been labelled. This form of learning is useful for classifications and regressions.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Semi-supervised Learning:
                    <div>The algorithm predicts the labels of data through assumptions, comparing them to a small set of existing data that are labelled, as well as a set of data that are unlabelled. The model improves itself through a loop as it goes through the labelled and unlabelled data. This form of training is useful when large amounts of labelled data are expensive or hard to obtain, and large amounts of unlabelled data are readily available.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unsupervised Learning
                    <div>The algorithm predicts the labels of data by attempting to find structure in a set of unlabelled data without specific instructions. This data can be organized in several ways:</div>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Clustering
                    <div>The data is grouped based on similarities or differences based on structures or patterns.</div></li>
                    <li>Anomaly Detection
                    <div>The data is analysed, and outliers and anomalies are labelled. This form is useful to point out malicious activity such as bank transactions.</div></li>
                    <li>Association
                    <div>The data is analysed, and the algorithm attempts to find relationships between the data and predicts future data sets. This is commonly used in marketing to recommend items to buyers based off their purchases.</div></li>
                    <li>Autoencoders
                    <div>The data is compressed, and the algorithm attempts to recreate the input data. This method can be used to remove noise from visual data to improve their quality.</div></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reinforced Learning
                    <div>The algorithm predicts labels of data and improves itself through trial and error based on previous results. This form of learning is commonly used in video game environments.</div>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                One of the most popular technologies which uses Generative AI are products from OpenAI. You’ve probably heard these names before:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> – a language model which generates text-based content from user text-input in a conversational manner.</li>
                <li>DALL-E – a diffusion model which generates image-based content from user text-input.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Effects of Generative AI</h2>

            <blockquote class='left'>
                We are now becoming ever more reliant upon the technologies’ powers of reasoning and less reliant upon our own. 
                <div>- Ted Hunt</div>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The development of Generative AI has been a breakthrough in the technological world as it opens a new world of possibilities that are available in a blink of an eye. 
            </p>
                
            <p> 
                Although we might not have noticed it, the presence of Generative AI has already affected the way we consume information. As more than 305.5 billion webpages of information is readily available at the press of button, individuals are gaining access to information at a faster rate than ever before. But this privilege has caused the ability for individuals to retain information after learning about it to decrease – this phenomenon is called the “<a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/google-effect">Google effect</a>,” also known as digital amnesia. This can in-turn affect the way we problem-solve, learn, and remember information as the comfort of easily accessible information lowers the need for those qualities. This isn’t to say that Generative AI is all bad, in fact, with the weight of energy-draining tasks lifted off, this technology has increased productivity in individuals, allowing us to get work done with lower levels of stress.
            </p>

            <p>
                Generative AI is also used in countless industries in society and is only set to expand to be involved in many more. These industries include: pharmacy, manufacturing, media, engineering, medical, and so many more. This technology is useful in taking over previously man-controlled tasks which take lots of time and effort, such as generating content, summarizing, classification, etc. The development of Generative AI also greatly benefits the research field, benefiting various areas such as medical breakthroughs, improving education, and overcoming language barriers. But maintaining this technology is not an easy task, as errors commonly occur which causes normal human errors we’re seeking to avoid being reproduced and worsened instead. 
            </p>

            <h3>Deepfakes</h3>

            <figure>
                <img src="https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/07f6d7f0ed8e11ed819979969b4b51e2/web-48418581920-1696961196907.jpg" alt="A visualisation of deepfake technology scanning the face">
                <figcaption>
                    The power of deepfakes in <a href="https://yourstory.com/2023/10/celebrity-deepfake-indian-ads"> advertisements</a>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Deepfakes are a subset of Generative AI, it collects data of someone’s appearance, and generates new content portraying false depictions of that individual – this can include speech, action, and behaviour. Deepfake media can be extremely realistic, so much so that it’s almost impossible to differentiate what’s real and what’s fake, this is thanks to a deep learning technique called GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). The application of GANs shows that the more data you have on an individual, the more realistic the deepfake is going to turn out, this is why most deepfakes are of famous celebrities as they have thousands of accessible data on the internet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Deepfakes are used in a plethora of ways, varying from making a celebrity say something funny, to bringing back loved ones to say a final goodbye. But not all applications of this versatile technology are positive, we’ve all probably heard of the legal struggles the world of deepfakes has brought before. 
            </p>

            <h4>Child Exploitation Through Deepfakes</h4>

            <p>
                Exploitative content has been an ongoing problem, especially amongst children. The circulation of child pornography places a horrifying danger for children all around the world, and deepfakes only makes the problem worse. The development of deepfakes removes a crucial barrier that protects children around the world – physical involvement. 98% of deepfakes are pornographic content, and it’s become easier to generate this as media can be produced from simple images. This places a fear for all as every image shared onto social media becomes potential data material for exploiters to collect and use. As newer generations consume and interact with the internet more and more, the data being supplied is only set to increase, placing children in danger by simply sharing a selfie on their social media page. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Deepfake pornography is hard to penalize, but governments around the world have been working to combat this form of content from being generated, some notable examples are:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Australia – <a href="https://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/osa2021154/s75.html">Online Safety Act 2021 Section 75</a>
                    <div>This section of the act makes it a civil offence to post intimate images of a person without their consent online, unfortunately, this act does not cover the creation of deepfakes of the manner. Despite this, this act is used to combat the circulation of deepfake pornography and could lead to fines towards the individual if they fail to remove the media.</div>
                <li>America – <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-386.2/">Virginia Code 18.2-386.2</a>
                    <div>The Viriginia Code states that  “Any person who, with the intent to coerce, harass, or intimidate, maliciously disseminates, or sells any videographic or still image created by any means whatsoever,” will face prosecution, this includes the generation of pornography using victims’ distinguishing features.</div>
                </li>

                    <div>The Deep Synthesis Provisions establish rules on the management of content and media generated with deep synthesis technologies for companies and organization which offer and utilize deep synthesis services. These regulations ensure clear transparency and safety of media that are generated by deepfakes, tackling many security concerns associated with this technology.</div>

        <h3>AI Generated Art</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/onlysky.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/are_ai_art_engines_ripping_off_artists.jpg?w=1200&quality=89&ssl=1" alt="AI generated art of robot in front of paintings">
            <figcaption>
                Can AI art really be considered art when they <a href="https://onlysky.media/alee/are-ai-art-programs-ripping-off-human-artists/">copy the style of human artists</a>?
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            As generative AI has seen the expanse of visual media, the generation of AI art has naturally begun to see a rise. Commonly, AI art is generated through text prompts, with services such as DALL-E or Adobe Firefly. Generating AI art also uses GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) in order to predict the outcome based on user-input, but other models are also used to generate this form of AI media: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) are used to identify objects, Neural Style Transfer is used to give the art its style, and RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) which are used to generated data sequences.
        </p>

        <p>
            The development of AI art makes one of the hardest human skills easy to master, but ethical concerns have come along with its usage. Most notably – Is AI Art considered real art?
        </p>

        <h4>AI Art vs Human Art</h4>

        <p>
            The positives of AI art are no different than that of AI text-generation, it increases productivity, stimulates creativity, allows for the exploration of ideas we would have never thought of before, the list goes on. But the introduction of quick-accessed art has undermined one of the most complex forms of expression humans have cultivated throughout history. Art has been a crucial part of culture for everyone since the start of time, from cave carvings to digital art tablets, from Renaissance to abstract, each of these all share one common denominator – the time and meaning humans put into creating them. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The quick nature of AI art has made it one of the most common ways of creating art for anything, from advertisements, a desktop background, a profile picture. But the generation of this art has to be sourced from something, and this has led to a huge issue – AI art generators have been collected copyrighted data from artists without their permission. This issue has caused debates online to skyrocket about the commercial use of AI art. Is it really fair for AI art to be put up against the hard work of humans? 
        </p>

        <blockquote class='right'>
            “AI doesn’t look at art and create its own. It samples everyone’s then mashes it into something else.” <div>- Anoosha Syed</div>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Humans spend countless hours and energy into creating works of art that are unique, with deep meaning woven in their masterpieces. When this work is freely taken by AI models in order to generate content with the same style in the matter of seconds, it creates an unfair playing field which puts humans at a major disadvantage. Amongst a society where efficiency is crucial, AI art has started to overtake humans, making the already-competitive job market for art an impossible goal for most. One of the most valuable human sources, creativity, is also excluded from the competition when AI art is introduced. The ability for the brain to create original pieces of work is all thanks to our ability to think outside of the box. As AI art is able to create completely new pieces of content from a click of a button, even if the art is a combination of thousands of already existing works, some still consider its works “original,” which can easily lead artists to be unmotivated.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This isn’t to mean that art is a lost cause for humans, the emotions conveyed through art created by us is irreplaceable, impossible for robots to recreate. Some artists have actually used AI art as a new medium to express what they previously couldn't.

        <h2>What Can be Done?</h2>

        <p>
            When discussing Generative AI, it is clear that many rules and regulations should be enforced in order to prevent misuse.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/6m8UEQrvz8l76tK4H4RLax4ttViLucuaRAoy6moYpas.png" alt="An AI generated robot">

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Regulating Data Sources</h3>

        <p>
            Targeting the root of the technology is essential when tackling the problems Generative AI brings. Companies that offer Generative AI services should monitor and regulate the data being fed into their AI models. This includes looking out for offensive content, copyrighted content, and data which could be used to generate media without consent of the person(s) included. The implementation of strict regulations on data can greatly reduce the generation of deepfake content used to exploit, harass, and manipulate others as material is reviewed by humans to ensure the safety of children and people. Regulations can also decrease the unfair competition between humans and AI in the production of creative media, when copyrighted content is removed from the data sets of AI models, artists do not need to worry about their art being stolen to be recreated, maintaining value of human art in the market. Even if these regulations mean that Generative AI is no longer as efficient as before, the importance of safety and originality should be valued over convenience.
        </p>

        <h3>Transparency</h3>

        <p>
            When companies and individuals make use of Generative AI, requirements should be implemented to ensure that audiences are informed of the use of AI models. This is especially important when Generative AI is used commercially, as consumers have a right to know the authenticity of the product/service they are buying, and the use of Generative AI to create advertisements and other promotional content may skew with the reality of the product. This is also crucial in clarifying the truth of deepfake videos, as they commonly depict untrue speech said by influential figures, which often cause confusion for the public. Furthermore, it would ensure that AI generated art is not passed off as art created by a human, preventing the unfair use of AI art when human-created art is required/preferred.
        </p>

        <h3>A Source of Inspiration</h3>

        <blockquote class='right'>
            “Generative models are a key enabler of machine creativity, allowing machines to go beyond what they’ve seen before and create something new.” 
            <div>- Ian Goodfellow</div>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Finally, Generative AI should be used as a source of inspiration. The development of such a convenient and accessible technology has changed the way we use the internet, it has made researching easier, and overcomes many challenges that we previously faced when using the internet. But Generative AI is not perfect, it is an innovative technology which still has many faults, this means that the generated content may not always be correct, and it is up to us to differentiate. Generative AI is a fantastic way to generate ideas that we might not have thought of before, and despite the unique media that AI models produce, AI generated content should never be passed off as human work and should stay as a form of brainstorming to be built upon.
