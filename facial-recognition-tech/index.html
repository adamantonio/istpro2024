            <h2>A brief introduction to facial recognition</h2>
            <p>
                You’ve probably heard of the term coined by Apple- “Face ID”, as it seems to be everywhere, from their iPhones and laptops to their iPads. 
                Face ID pretty much refers to facial recognition, and over the past few years, it has been incorporated into a large sector of daily life
                and technologies, from border security to airports, paying for groceries, and popular facial recognition devices in China, such as Megvii.
            </p>

            <p>
                In today’s article, we’ll be discussing some of the issues that facial recognition can potentially raise in our society.  
            </p>

            <h2>But first, what is it?</h2>
            <p>
                Facial recognition works in a biometric process that uses data points. This is where a map of your face is created with an analysis of the characteristics, 
                including the eye shape, the distance between focus features (nose, mouth, eyes, eyebrows, lips, etc.), and the overall structure and face shape. 
                After these points match up with the face that the device recognises and knows is correct, it triggers the unlock. While the process of facial recognition 
                differs from technology to technology, the most common devices (such as iPhones and security) use roughly the same process described above.  
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no doubt that facial recognition is an extremely convenient aspect of technology and daily life- especially when used for virtually harmless procedures, 
                such as Face ID on iPhones.  
            </p>

            <h2>What are some of the problems that extend from facial recognition?</h2>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, facial recognition seems to bring forward three major social and ethical issues in our society, which are:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The increased possibility of data breaches, where an individual’s face could be used for identity theft, stalking, or harassment. </strong></li>
                <p>
                    This is where facial recognition heavily differs from the traditional password, as it 	cannot be easily changed like the latter. Continuing on from identity theft, 
                    it is becoming increasingly common, with three dimensional replicas of faces being made and used to imitate individuals. It is also much easier to capture a face secretly 
                    from a distance, rather than other biometrics such as a fingerprint or a retina scan- therefore heightening the possibilities of identity theft. One’s face could also 
                    be captured by many unencrypted security cameras or third-party tools, meaning that almost anyone could access it and find who you are. 
                <div>
                    The infamous <a href= "https://www.afr.com/technology/how-clearview-ai-unleashed-a-global-dystopia-20230929-p5e8lc#:~:text=In%20Australia%2C%20the%20Administrative%20Appeals,more%20than%203%20billion%20images">Clearview AI</a> incident (where the company excavated billions of faces from the internet without the permission of the individuals portrayed and advertised that they could identify anyone with 98.6 
                    percent accuracy) is a prime example of how facial recognition can ultimately lead to more difficulty in remaining anonymous online and protecting your identity.  
                </div>
                </p>
                
                <li><strong>Inaccuracy and prone to sometimes racially motivated bias. </strong></li>
                <p>
                    This can be seen in Nijeer Parks’ case, where he was wrongly accused of a multitude of crimes due to a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/29/tech/nijeer-parks-facial-recognition-police-arrest/index.html">false facial recognition scan.</a> These charges included assault, use of a fake ID, marijuana possession, resisting arrest, leaving the scene of a crime,possession of weapons, 
                    and last but certainly not least, attempting to hit a police officer with a car. It had eventually taken 10 days in jail and a year for the law to drop the charges- therefore giving us an insight into how facial recognition can possibly give rise to already prominent issues in our society. 
                    <div>
                        <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html">A 2018 study</a> by a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, Joy Buolamwini, also gives us an awareness about how facial recognition scans are still liable to prejudice against certain groups. The results showed that up to almost 35
                        percent of errors occurred with women of colour (especially those with darker skin tones), which contrasted greatly with the data of white males- who were recognised by the software correctly 99 percent of the time.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                         Another incident similar to the first case is <a href= "https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/wrongfully-arrested-because-face-recognition-cant-tell-black-people-apart">Robert Williams</a>, a Black man who was arrested in front of his wife and two children (aged 2 and 5, respectively) in 2020 due to a 
                        recognition error in the Michigan State Police software. There were only two similarities that Williams shared with the true culprit- they were both African American and large framed. 
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        Both Parks and Williams cases (who also happen to be both Black), along with Buolamwini’s 2018 study, show us how facial recognition can be detrimental towards an already-over policed and oppressed minority- 
                        people of colour and women.
                    </div>  
                </p>

                <blockquote class="left">
                <strong>“You can’t have ethical A.I. that’s not inclusive,”</strong>

                </blockquote>

                <li><strong>Misuse of the technology- leading to invasion of privacy and the limitation of free speech.</strong> </li>
                <p>
                    Of course, security cameras are also associated with facial recognition, due to their ability to record and identify individuals, which may be potentially intrusive towards the general public. 
                    Many may feel threatened at the thought of their every action being filmed and captured, causing higher levels of stress and poorer mental health. Facial recognition can also be misused in basic 
                    rights, such as freedom of speech. 
                    <div>
                        Throughout the 2020 “Black Lives Matter” movement, the San Francisco Police Department acquired <a href="https://www.eff.org/fr/deeplinks/2020/12/high-tech-police-surveillance-protests-and-activism-year-review-2020">control of over 400</a> cameras to monitor protestors without their 
                        permission or knowledge- an intrusion on humanity’s right to protest and identity with (and for) causes that they hold in high regard.  
                    </div>
                </p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h2>How can we use facial recognition safely without putting anyone at risk?</h2>
            <p>
                Even though these risks still remain, facial recognition software continues to improve and become more reliable every day. While some of these issues, such as the bias that facial recognition technologies can show, 
                there are still some things we can do to make facial recognition safer for everyone though. These include using it correctly with the right intent and being more aware and educated on how these technologies work, 
                as well as choosing carefully what to share online.
                Some issues can also be avoided by implementing stricter regulations regarding how countries and companies use facial recognition in their actions. Companies that use the individuals’ faces should furthermore be 
                taking actions to prevent any wrongful use of their tools to prevent any future issues with how these technologies are used within our world. 
                This could include restrictions as to who accesses their databases and stronger security measures, lowering the risk of data breaches. The storing and use of data should also be honest to give the public the ability to control how their data is used- 
                especially in cases such as Clearview AI. If people were given the power to regulate how their biometric data is used, it would drastically lower the chances of stalkers, hackers, or anyone will ill intent being able to access their data.  
            </p>

        <h2>So, what do we do now?</h2>
            <p>
                Facial recognition is a life changing and extremely powerful tool in our modern-day society, hence why it is so important to be educated on how to use it safely, without putting anyone at risk of harm. 
                As mentioned before, technology that does involved facial recognition has thankfully been steadily improving and it can now be used to for multiple purposes, such as finding and identifying missing persons, criminals, and even illnesses from scanning a person's face. 

                <div>
                    Ultimately, while it is important to never let the more negative aspects of a device define its entire purpose, it is always ideal to stay vigilant when using facial recognition or when out and about.
