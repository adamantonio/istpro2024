            <blockquote class='right'>
                Through this analysis, a computer... can create a natural sounding voice... so well that no one would be able to tell it wasn't real.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-an-ai-voice-generator/">Artificial Technology (AI) voice generation and cloning</a>, also known as voice synthesis, refers to how computer systems change text into human-like voice through an intricate system of algorithms that analyse various voice recordings of human speech. With this analysis, a computer can work out the varying patterns in speech within individuals including the accents and pace of the speakers in the recordings to create a natural-sounding voice or even clone an individual’s voice so well that no one would be able to tell it wasn’t real. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This technology is slightly different from Text-to-Speech (TTS) as it utilises the in-depth analysis of actual voice recordings to create more human-like and realistic voices, rather than the basic, pre-set voices used in Outlook, Wikipedia, Instagram and many other services. Even so, this technology still requires the basis of Text-to-Speech to convert text into a speech by assigning a voice to it. The difference is that this time, the voice assigned to the text could be a super realistic voice of a stranger… or yours.  
            </p>

            <h3>Purpose of this technology</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>main</strong> purposes of this technology are to provide greater accessibility and improve efficiency of certain tasks and jobs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                AI voice generation or cloning can produce voices that are more emotive than the current default, robotic-sounding digital voices used in most websites and apps, which allows individuals who require this auditory service to better understand the tone and context of the text being read out. The added details to the voices will be able to clearly convey the tone of whatever the text it is reading is like, which helps enhance accessibility for individuals with visual impairments, or those who are unable to read text and require it to be read out for them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, AI voice generation increases the efficiency of jobs such as creating audiobooks, podcasts and many other multimedia tasks requiring spoken audio. This is a result of the hours of labour that could be saved by having AI generate realistic voices to text in a few minutes, or even, seconds, rather than having a human voice actor do the narrations, which could take hours to record, and even longer to practise <em>before</em> the recording. By having this technology, not only would it save money for businesses, but it would reduce workload and time needed to spend on recording information.

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>
                As stated above, AI voice generation and voice cloning each have many purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are some of the features they <strong>both</strong> have:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Producing a more <strong>realistic voice</strong></li>
                <li>Makes content more engaging through the more <strong>detailed and natural sounding voice(s)</strong> that can <strong>emphasise parts of the text through tonality</strong> to match context of what is being read out</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                AI voice cloning:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clones an individual’s voice so that it <strong>can be reused again and again when required</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                AI voice generation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Voices that are generated can be translated into <strong>multiple languages</strong> (which reduces the language barrier)</li>
                <li><strong>Many voice options</strong> for the generated voice (not only options such as speed, but also the tonality, accents etc.) can be chosen, which allows it to be <strong>tailored to the user’s needs</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Current applications of this technology</h3>
            <p>
                Since AI voice is an emerging technology, not many products currently utilise it to its full use. Despite this, services such as virtual assistants (Siri, Cortana, Alexa etc.), or forms of entertainment like audiobooks are starting to implement the use of AI voice generation. Eventually, once this technology becomes more widespread and familiar, virtual assistants will have many more voice options and settings, all through the help of AI voice generation. Audiobooks will become reliant towards AI voice generation and/or AI voice cloning to create the readings of the texts, due to its convenience (people will not need to spend hours recording audio just for one audiobook).
            </p>
            <p>
                Many companies such as <a href="https://lovo.ai/">LOVO</a>, <a href="https://speechify.com/">Speechify</a> and <a href="https://murf.ai/">Murf</a> all focus on making and improving AI voice generation and voice cloning. They offer individuals a chance to try out the technology and make a clone of their voice as AI voice starts spread around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst there are not many current applications of AI voice, its basis, Text-to-Speech, is used as an accessibility service across many aspects in technology. From Siri to website accessibility options, to Microsoft Office apps, all of these use Text-to-Speech to make content listenable for any individual using technology.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Influence of this technology</h3>
            <p>
                As with all technology, AI voice generation and cloning has many effects on individuals and their society, with many positive and negative impacts. This section will explore a few of the main influences this technology has on society.
            </p>

            <blockquote class='left'>
                By around 2028, over 600 000 Australians will lose their jobs as a result of AI and other technology
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                By having AI voice generation, many jobs will become more efficient and less reliant on human resources and labour. However, whilst this improves cost and efficiency of businesses and companies, this will result in a decrease in certain job opportunities within society, and individuals are predicted to be working less hours each week. <a href="https://cica.org.au/wp-content/uploads/cisco-future-of-australian-jobs-report2019.pdf">Cisco</a> predicts that by around 2028, over 600 000 Australians will lose their jobs as a result of AI and other technology. Even so, despite seeming like a daunting idea, AI voice generation (and AI in general) will actually create new jobs opportunities like AI trainers, for example, which is when a person provides the computer with data, such as vocabulary or how to interpret the details of a voice recording, to produce an artificial (but natural sounding) voice to read the text. 
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Moreover, AI voice cloning will most likely lead to an increase in the spread of false information and content, such as fake voice messages, videos and news reports. This will lead to a sense of distrust within individuals in society because of the uncertainty of every piece of information they receive online. As a consequence, many people may not know about important pieces of news as they will not rely on digital news since they will not be able to tell the difference between real news and fake news. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, it is very important for users who are utilising AI voice to ensure they are using this technology in an ethical, legal and, preferably, socially acceptable way.
            </p>

            <h3>Issues faced</h3>
            <p>
                AI voice generation and cloning <em>both</em> have multiple ethical, social and legal issues. A few of such issues regarding each of the three aspects will be explored below.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Content authenticity</strong>: As previously said, AI voice cloning will make it a lot easier for people to spread false or misleading information. The technology makes misrepresentation quite effortless to execute which means individuals could be framed for actions they never carried out in reality, deeply influencing the perspectives people could have of one another as a result. This can be done through the mimicking of a well-known individual’s voice, for instance, in order to widespread fake announcements and news. Such example is when citizens of the US received calls apparently from Joe Biden himself to tell them <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fake-joe-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-democrats-not-vote-tuesday-rcna134984">not to vote in the presidential primary</a>. However, this was later found out to be artificially generated in unlawful ways. Not only does this manipulate public views and opinions very quickly, but it can also damage the reputation of the person whose voice has been used without their permission, which leads on to the next point about consent and security of this technology.</li>
                <blockquote class='right'>
                    However, the price for this convenience is the risk of hackers obtaining this information and exploiting this data
                </blockquote>
                <li><strong>Consent and security</strong>: As AI voice cloning becomes more available to all people, many consent issues may arise. Just like face ID, touch ID, passwords and even, photos, AI voice cloning’s convenience will likely lead to many people storing their own copy of their voice into their devices. However, the price for this convenience is the risk of hackers obtaining this information and exploiting this data without any permission. Additionally, even people such as family and friends may use spoken audio, without the consent of the person who has spoken in that video, to create a clone of the individual’s voice. This could lead to many other issues, but ultimately, it is often the violation of privacy and consent policies that sparks other problems. An instance of how easily AI voice cloning bypasses current security boundaries is when on March 2023, a journalist, Nick Evershed, explained how he was able to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/16/voice-system-used-to-verify-identity-by-centrelink-can-be-fooled-by-ai">gain admittance into his own Centrelink account through the self-service option using his cloned digital voice</a>. This effectively underscored the serious issue in the voice identification system’s security, being too easily accessible by, in due course, other individuals if the use of AI voice becomes constantly exploited.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity of usage</strong>: Even though this may not seem like a huge issue currently, eventually, socially unacceptable use of AI voice generation and cloning could lead to many long-term social issues that may take months, years, or even, generations to fix. As AI voice becomes accessible to almost everyone on the planet, even ordinary citizens could abuse the use of this technology. Individuals will have the potential to form many prejudices and hate towards specific groups of people in the community. Whilst this could already happen in social media, AI voice generation and cloning makes it easier to spread propaganda or other misleading information in more convincing ways as spoken audio will still remain as evidence of truthfulness of information (at least until this technology is more familiar and integrated within society, and individuals learn how to spot out suspicious audio and protect themselves from it).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Recommendation</h2>
            <p>
                As many flaws as AI voice generation and cloning may have, no technology is ever perfect, and there are many ways in which everyone can contribute to a safe and comfortable digital environment through appropriate use.

            <blockquote class='left'>
                Usage terms and conditions should be clear in a way that is not deceptive to the individual who is offering their data to be used
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                A very important step towards this is transparency of people’s use of AI voice. Whether it is another person’s voice, your own voice, or a generated voice, content creators should be aware of the choices they make with the voice and the content they are depicting. By having access to other people’s digitally cloned voices, they need to ensure that they have the permission to use this data in a way acceptable by both parties. The usage terms and conditions should be clear in a way that is not deceptive to the individual who is offering their data to be used, and this personal information should not be exploited in any way. As illustrated before, this technology makes reusing other individuals’ voice much easier if this data is somehow accessed without permission, or if the data has been given, but the people are misusing it in some way. As AI voice becomes an integrated part of society, legal structures can be added to enhance and clarify these requirements. These responsibilities are crucial to ensuring trust of using this technology within society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, when using AI voice, the narrative or information being conveyed needs to be truthful and not impact the person whose voice is being used. Even if it is not the person with the voice being used fault, individuals will not be able to tell that the audio is fake just merely by listening to it under most circumstances, thus if false information is spread, the blame is likely to be pinned to the person “speaking”, not the people behind the scenes. However, this sense of distrust and constant misunderstanding within society can be avoided if individuals are prevented from sending out any deceptive information should AI voice cloning be used. AI could self-scan the information that is about to be sent and decide whether it is a true fact or not. If the scan is inaccurate, this is when the important decisions a content creator makes is <em>very</em> significant as individuals are relying on reliable sources of news to obtain most information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, AI voice generation and voice cloning both have various positive and negative impacts on individuals in society. Even so, these negative influences can be reduced if everyone takes the initiative to use this technology in the most honest way possible so that it can continue to be used safely and acceptably within society.
