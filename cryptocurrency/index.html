            <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency is digital money, through the use of cryptographic techniques, that doesn’t require a financial institution (eg. bank) or the government to maintain and regulate the online transactions. 
            </p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>
                These transactions are checked and then recorded on a <u>blockchain</u> (an unchangeable ledger that tracks and records trades and assets AND enables cryptocurrency to actually exist).
            </p>

            <h3>How is cryptocurrency stored?</h3>
            <p>
                A cryptocurrency wallet is necessary, this can be software such as Trezor or stored on the individual’s mobile device. These wallets are used to provide links to your cryptocurrency and are where the encryption keys – passwords developed through algorithms - are stored to confirm one’s identity and protect the individual’s crypto data.
            </p>

            <h3>Why was cryptocurrency developed?</h3>
            <p>
                It was created after the <em>2008 Global Financial Crisis</em> – which resulted in the global population to become less reliant and fearful over their lack of control of their own money – as a way to grant the people more control over their money without it being entirely dependent on an institution such as the government or banks.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Cryptocurrency</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Bitcoin</u> was founded in 2009 and was the first cryptocurrency. It was and is still the most commonly traded cryptocurrency and was designed to be a digital alternative to physical money. It was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym for an individual or group of people, who is still anonymous) who was the first one to successfully market cryptocurrency so therefore essentially made cryptocurrency and paved the way for others.</li>
                
                <li><u>Ethereum</u> (ETH) was developed in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and is a decentralised blockchain platform. It is the second most popular form of cryptocurrency and its purpose is to allow the blockchain to be used for developers to create their own projects (dApps) and implement smart contracts – which are digital contracts stored on the blockchain that when specific terms and conditions are met, the contract is executed.</li>
                
                <li><u>Solana</u> (SOL) was launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko and is known for its high-performance speed and low transaction costs. Through the utilisation of the consensus mechanism Proof of History together with the consensus model Proof of Stake, Solana is able to process thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the cryptocurrencies with the highest transaction speed. With this Solana achieves its objective of exceeding the normal speed of transactions whilst maintaining low costs. It is a major rival of Ethereum due to also being used for the development of decentralised apps (dApps).</li>

            <h2>Analysis of Cryptocurrency</h2>

            <h3>What is the effect of cryptocurrency on individuals?</h3>

            <p>
                First and foremost, individuals have been able to have more financial independence due to the decentralisation of cryptocurrencies and it not being controlled by any sort of authority. This has allowed people more control over their personal assets and the ability to transact internationally without reliance on the usual banking systems. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Secondly, cryptocurrency has provided people with many more investment opportunities due to the amount of different cryptocurrencies which can lead to the individual’s financial growth and accumulation of wealth, if invested successfully.
            </p>

            <blockquote class='right'>
                In 2023 alone, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crypto-scam-risk-bbb-report/#:~:text=Scammers%20have%20found%20creative%20ways">80% of Americans targeted by cryptocurrency scams lost money.</a>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                However, despite these benefits towards the individual, there are also harms to the use of cryptocurrency. For example; cryptocurrency has a high volatility meaning that the amount of money can drastically fluctuate and result in both substantial gains and losses for the individual. Furthermore, the individual could fall victim to a cybercrime because of the crypto market being susceptable to crime (which will be explored more later on).
            </p>

            <h3>What is the effect of cryptocurrency on society?</h3>
            <p>
                A positive impact that cryptocurrency has had on society is the encouragement of financial inclusion. Traditional financial institutions quite often exclude marginalised communities, restricting that communities access to the basic banking services. Through the decentralised manner of cryptocurrency, the usual excluded parts of society are able to actively participate in the global economy and receive the necessary access to those banking services as well as have that independent control over their assets and money.

            <p>
                A study called the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/">2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index</a> has measured the countries with the highest levels of cryptocurrency usage. Within the top ten are Vietnam, Pakistan, Nigeria, Argentina and Venezuela. These results are testament to the societies of these countries wanting to be able to actively partake in the economy and control their assets due to having faced corruption and economic instability in the past. Thus, there has been a significant positive impact on society, especially those in developing countries, due to wanting to be able to manage their own finances without an intermediary.

            <h3>Legal Issue with Cryptocurrency: Crimes</h3>
            
            <blockquote class='left'>
                In 2022, Ethereum and Bitcoin (the two biggest crypto platforms) were subject to crypto scams that resulted in the loss of $3.8 billion worth of crypto.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency has become increasingly more popular over the years and has impacted many economies because of the mass amount of people using these high-risk high reward platforms. Despite cryptocurrencies main appeals to the public being its detachment from institutions such as the bank and government and its anonymity for transactions, these also come with their own sets of flaws. Due to this lack of regulations and security within the crypto market, many sorts of crimes have taken place and, additionally, because of this promise of anonymity it becomes a more arduous and difficult task to track back these criminals. 
            </p>

            <p>Examples of cryptocurrency theft are...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a keylogger (a form of malware that captures information as it is typed) which results in the gain of a person’s account details such as passwords and/or private keys</li>
                <li>A fraudster manipulates the individual, through appearing as a trusted organisation or person, into handing over personal information or downloading a malicious file or application. This is also known as phishing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Actually in March 2022, the Ronin network was subject to phishing through a senior engineer downloading a PDF file that was in reality containing spyware. This resulted in the hacker, who was believed to be part of the North Korean Lazarus Group, gaining control over four of the network’s validator keys. This led to 173,000 Ethereum and $25.5 million being stolen, amounting to a total loss of $620 million.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, even though people are aware of technological scams that can take place, this doesn’t stop cryptocurrency being a platform susceptible to crime for a number of reasons.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><u>Transactions of cryptocurrency are irreversible</u>, once verified on the blockchain. That means that if an individual was exploited into sending cryptocurrency to a fraudster thinking that they would get something in return and they didn’t receive anything, there is no way for them to get back their stolen cryptocurrency.</li>
                <li><u>Cryptocurrency transactions can remain anonymous</u>, meaning that it is an inviting opportunity for criminals to engage in illegal transactions and activities such as money laundering whilst hiding their identity. Together with cryptocurrency being decentralised, it is hard to find someone to be held accountable.</li>
                <li>The main reason as to why these crimes are difficult to track is because of the <u>lack of oversight and regulations</u> due to the decentralised nature of cryptocurrency which is what made it so popular in the first place. Since cryptocurrency is decentralised that means that there are many different control centres for the cryptocurrency which results in the challenge of all these transactions being hard to monitor.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Recommendation</h2>
            <img src="https://blog.rblbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/what-is-kyc-m.jpg">
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency crimes can be prevented through the implementation of AML (Anti Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) policies. AML involves a variety of actions that financial institutions are required to take for the prevention of illegal activities. KYC is a key component of the AML and its prime focus is to verify the user’s identity and ultimately prevent crimes such as money laundering. 
            </p>

            <p>
                KYC does this by collecting personal information on the user such as their account details and previous transactions. It also requires identity verification and creates a risk assessment of the individual by looking to see if there are any sanctions against them. With this fraudsters and hackers are deterred from participating in any illegal activity and if they do decide to partake in illegal practices, they can easily be tracked down by the information collected on them by the KYC policy. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, the implementation of KYC and AML is adding a stricter regulation to cryptocurrency addressing that issue of the crypto market having a lack in oversight and policies. It is also responding to the problem of criminals not being identified due to the anonymity of transactions as these newly implemented policies gather personal information for easy tracking of perpetrators. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <u>Note: </u>Although some cryptocurrencies have already had KYC implemented, due to crypto’s decentralised nature, not all have the policy which is why this is the most important recommendation.
