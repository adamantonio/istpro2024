            <h2>Introduction to Virtual Reality</h2>
            <h3>Purpose and features:</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">Virtual Reality</a> (VR) is a form of technology which allows a simulated three dimensional environment to be utilised and interacted with by users. It is used for many purposes such as gaming, movies, therapy, patient care and more. This computer generated simulation alters the users’ perception of reality through digital surroundings and interactions which are stimulated through physical, interactive equipment. These pieces of equipment may include headsets, goggles, gloves, body suits or consoles. The most common and well known type of virtual reality equipment is a headset which has a screen inside of it and uses motion sensors to perceive a user’s movement, allowing them to embrace a unique, artificial environment. As a term, this is also known as <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence>telepresence</a>. In VR, the technology tricks the eyes and brain by imitating the same way which it visualises images. It does this by displaying two pairs of offsetted images from different perspectives in relation to the eye  rather than a singular image across the screen. This allows the brain to view the experience as a multi-dimensional image.
            </p>
            <h3>Hardware and software:</h3>
            <p>Virtual Reality utilises a variety of hardware such as headsets, controllers, trackers, consoles and cameras. However, the most commonly and well known hardware type associated with VR sets are headsets. An example of a type of VR headset is a standalone VR headset. They are wireless forms of hardware such as iphones and laptops which don’t require extra hardware to function. In addition to the many forms of VR hardware needed to function, other smaller hardware is also sometimes used. Some examples of these other forms of hardware are optical trackers, gloves, motion controllers, Omnidirectional Treadmills  (ODTs) and 3D mouses. Many of these may be additionally needed for specific games or programs while using the VR set which means some are separately bought or used. For example, VR gloves are forms of VR accessories which are used for physical interaction with the 3D environment. 
                There are also various forms of software which developers use to create Virtual Reality sets. Some types of software used in VR include VR Game engine software; which is used by developers to make their video games or programs. Another type of software used is VR content management system  software. This software is used as a tool to store, collect and analyse resources. It can also be seen as the main storage area for VR content made by developers.

            <h2>Exisiting products</h2>

            <p>Some exisiting products:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meta Quest 2 ($299.99):</strong> Meta Quest is a VR headset which is widely known for its convenient setup and slim design which suits everyday lives. It is considered an ‘all-in-one’ VR headset which means that no extra hardware is necessary to utilise the product, making it easy to use. Design wise, an issue with this headset is that the front is heavy and the strap isn’t very easy to adjust. Meta Quest 2 is mainly used for gaming with games such as beatsaber, among us and Pistol Whip.</li>
                <li><strong>PlayStation VR2 ($549.99)</strong> The Playstation VR2 is another example of an existing tethered virtual reality product which was recently released in 2023. This headset is primarily for gaming and contains a large library for users to choose from. The hardware includes a heavy seal around the eyes to keep daylight from seeping through while also allowing the use of glasses, an adjustable strap and inbuilt headphones for gameplay sound. It also comes with controllers and requires a Playstation 5 to operate.</li>

            <h2>The impacts and issues of Virtual Reality</h2>
            <p>
                There have been numerous effects which virtual reality have had on society and individuals. VR may have a great effect on the trajectory of a variety of aspects within society and individuals.. VR may allow a number of sporting events to be done right at home. The same goes for training. For example, the technology could create a virtual soccer match setting where users are still able to pay for seating while they watch real players play virtually. Similarly, this could be done with education as well. VR may become a more immersive and engaging form of learning for more students as they are able to interact with a virtual world which teaches them while altering their perception of reality. An example for a lesson in VR could be a history lesson which allows a replicated simulation of the past. VR would also impact healthcare in society in a number of ways. It allows diagnosis and fast ways to treat diseases and illnesses. Currently, VR is able to detect illnesses such as glaucoma, schizophrenia and Alzhimer’s disease. It is also slowly being used to identify mental illnesses such as PTSD, anxiety and autism. Additionally, VR also allows enhanced collaboration and productivity  in the workspace. This enables collaboration and productivity, due to the lack of time needed to travel. It also enhances an immersive environment where users still feel as if they were there in reality despite being there virtually.

                VR at its best shouldn't replace real life, just modify it, giving us access to so much just out of reach physically, economically. If you can dream it, VR can make it. <strong>- MATTHEW SCHNIPPER</strong> 
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Despite Virtual reality being a big and successful step in technological advancements, it also poses and gets many people question about some ethical, legal and social issues which may occur as a result of the product. These issues also serve as a cause for the effects of VR on individuals and society. An example of ethical issues are overall making sure that VR content is managed appropriately and responsibly, especially in clinical usage. In many cases, VR has been seen as beneficial in managing stress, anxiety and enhancing cognitive function. However as VR continues to develop, taking the time to consider the possible issues which could arise. An ethical issue which may arise is the overuse of this type of cognitive care on patients or from regular users could create marginalised groups and result in a mindset of isolation due to the lack of real human interaction. Becoming immersed in a digital world away from reality may cause many other negative influences on users of patients who are already mentally or physically struggling. It may also create the idea that VR is a necessary form of treatment for patients. In the workplace, VR may also become a form of technology which eliminates the need for real human interactions. This additionally creates isolation within a community. The use of virtual reality also raises the question about how individuals represent and identify themselves online. Social issues such as harrassment, identity theft and privacy concerns may impact the reputation of VR and raise the question of its negative effects.

            <h2>Startegies and solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Various strategies and solutions can be taken in consideration to demonstrate acceptable use of Virtual Reality, despite its many flaws. It is important that the younger generation is taught about the use of this technology as well as responsible and acceptable behaviour as their futures will be heavily involved in its further development and usage. This means that educational programs should be implemented to teach students about varying topics such as cyber bullying, privacy protection and ethical decisions in the digital environment. By educating users about these topics, it will allow them to make better decisions in the future. Another strategy which should be implemented are guidelines and conduct. These guidelines should clearly display the expected and required behaviour whilst online. By violating these guidelines, users could receive warnings or bans which limit their usage. This strategy should encourage respectful and responsible conduct while in the VR world. Overall, by utilising and implementing a variety of solutions to ethical and social issues, Virtual Reality will be able to continuously develop and improve.
