            Lack of internet access is intensifying inequality, creating a digital divide, while net neutrality laws revoked in the United States give greedy telecommunications companies more control. The internet has had many positive impacts on society during its time but has also created a myriad of issues for the world. To understand what these statements mean, we first need to understand what the internet really is. 
        </p>

            <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
            

            <p>
                The internet is a virtual space where people can publish and digest knowledge, a network of billions of devices capable of sharing information with each other. This information can be in the form of text, images and videos, the possibilities are endless. Depending on how and where on the internet you are publishing information, everyone with internet access can see what you have shared.              </p>

            <p>Many people assume the internet is not a physical thing, however the internet is a <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com">network of undersea cables</a>   that connect us all. These cables are as large as a garden hose in diameter and can be made of metal or thin strands of glass, known as fibre optic cables. Fibre optic internet is faster and more efficient than regular cable, as light signals are transmitted to carry the data across the world. The issue begins to arise when people can choose between traditional cable internet that uses metallic wires for a lower price than fibre optic internet, which has a much higher installation cost, but is significantly more efficient. This results in wealthier countries, businesses and people having the ability to choose faster internet than others. </p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>The internet consists of both hardware (the physical components of a technology) and software. The hardware of the internet includes but is not limited to; </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Devices; mobile phones, laptops, etc </li>
                <li>Cabling </li>
                <li>Cellular towers, which allow the communication to occur between our devices and the internet </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/glossary/internet-exchange-point-ixp/">Internet exchange points</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/web-server"> Servers</a>, which enable the access to the information on the internet  </li>
                <li>Data centers, which are physical facilities that store data </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All the above systems enable the internet to operate in many locations across the globe. </p>
            <p>The software of the internet includes; </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The operating system (OS) of the device being used. The OS enables the interconnection between the user and hardware of a device. If you are reading this article on a Mac laptop, then the operating system that your device uses is macOS. If you are on a device manufactured by Microsoft, then the OS being used is Windows. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the operating system, there is the software that enables the following hardware to perform their functions;</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hubs</strong> connect the network devices together</li>
                <li><strong>Switches</strong> improve the efficiency of a network</li> 
                <li><strong>Routers</strong> forward packets* of information to their destination </li>
                <li><strong>Modems</strong> convert digital signals to analog signals 
                <li><strong>Access points</strong> connect a variety of network devices together 
            </ul>
            <p>*A packet is a small segment of a larger message, it is data sent via the internet. When the packets are received at their destination, they are recombined.</p>
            <p>The way the internet operates can be complex and difficult to understand, so I strongly encourage you to conduct your own research in areas that confuse or interest you. Having a better understanding of the internet enables a better understanding of the world in which you operate. </p>
            <p> Now that we have a better understanding of what the internet is and how it works, it is time to explore the issues that have emerged because of the internet and the impact they have on our world.</p>

            <h2>Dangers of the Digital Divide</h2>
            <p>
                Internet inequality is the unequal access to digital technology, which leads to a digital divide where some people cannot access information because they lack access to the internet. Internet inequality can occur for two reasons;  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>someone cannot afford access to the internet, or</li>
                <li>the area in which someone lives lacks the infrastructure to enable internet access.  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Digital divides can be between countries or within countries, which can create barriers between those with low incomes, limiting educational and economic opportunities that the internet may provide them with. This can leave families in an endless cycle of poverty, as they are unable to get a proper education using online resources, which makes it difficult to get a well-paying job and make a better life for themselves and their loved ones. Everyone deserves to have access to the information that the internet provides, and everyone should believe in making this a possibility for all. </p>
            <p>Additionally, there are ethical issues associated with the internet. Technology is advancing every day, becoming more efficient in the way it operates, hence so is the internet. There is the option for companies to pay a premium for fibre optic cables, which allows data to be delivered more quickly to their devices than traditional cable. An example of this would be investment banks or brokerage firms paying for fibre optic cables, which means that their computers would be receiving information about the price of stocks quicker than others. Many have argued that this provides the company with an unfair advantage. </p>

                ‘The idea that internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon should treat all content flowing through their cables and cell towers equally’ – Klint Finley</blockquote>

            <h3>Net Neutrality</h3>
                <p>Net neutrality is the principle that all packets are flowing through the internet with the same priority. </p>
                <p>In 2010, there was a court case between Comcast Corporation and the FCC (Federal Communications Commision), where Comcast argued that the FCC did not have jurisdiction over the content distribution choices of ISPs (Internet Service Providers). In the end, the FCC failed to preserve net neutrality. However, in 2015 the FCC voted in the ‘Open Internet Order’ which would require ISPs to uphold net neutrality. This meant there was net neutrality in the United States...until Trump came along in 2017 and got rid of the policies of net neutrality. This meant it was legal for ISPs to have paid prioritization and to block certain content as they no longer had to act according to net neutrality policies. In October of 2023, the FCC voted to approve a NPRM (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking) which would restore net neutrality and the rules ISPs had to follow. <a href="https://statescoop.com/fcc-open-internet-net-neutrality-2024-nprm">The FCC closed the commenting period</a> for this proposed rulemaking in January 2024. Currently, the US is not preserving net neutrality and no further information has been released on the matter. 

                </p>

            <h2>Seeking a Solution</h2>
            
            <p>I would argue that in today's world, access to the internet has become a basic human right, and if people are being denied the right to access information via the internet, then it is time for change. To reduce internet inequality and close the gap of the digital divide, governments need to invest in internet infrastructure that will provide people with secure and reliable access to the internet. Equal access to the internet assists in achieving equal opportunities for everyone.</p>

            <p>The FCC has an Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) that ensures households can afford the internet access needed for work, school, healthcare, etc. Unfortunately, this program is drawing to a close, with April 2024 being the last full month of the program. Programs such as the ACP should inspire governments to appropriately fund these programs to help their citizens achieve equal access to the internet. </p>

            <p>I will be following the outcome of the FCC’s actions on 'open internet protection’ closely and I encourage you to do the same. Net neutrality assures that the internet is a free and open space for everyone, and all ISPs should have to follow rules that preserve net neutrality.</p>
